       "'\"I HAVE A DREAM ...\" (Copyright 1963, MARTIN LtrTHER KING, JR.) Speooh by the Rev. MARTIN LuTHER KING At the \"March on vYashington\" I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatesŁt demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five years ago a great American in whose holic shado·w we stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momen:tous cleeree is a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slave·s who had been in the flames o[ withering injushcc. It came as a joyous daybre,ak to end the long night of their captivity. But 100 years late<r the Negro still is noŁt fre·e. One dred years later the 1i.fe of the Negro is still badly erippled by the manacles of s-tŁgrPg-ation and the chains of discriminatio11. One hnndred years later the Ne,gro live·s on a lone,Jy i:\"]and of poverty in the mids1t of a va1S1t ooean of matE>.rial prospc·rity. Out> hundred years later the egro is still iu the o.f Ame·rican and find;:; himself in exile in his own land. So wo\\'\\'\\'<\\' come hf\\'rP torlay to r1r.amatize a s,hameful condition. In a sense we\\'ve come to our nation\\'s capital to cash a eheck. Whrn the a. rebit ects of our Re:publie wrote the magnificent. wonls of the Constitution a.nd the Declaration o1 Independence, they we·re signing· a promiss\\'Cl<ry note to which eve·ry American wa:\" to fall heir. \\'I\\'his no,te was a promise that all nwn-yc::;, bla,ek men as we11 as white rmm-wonld he g1mnmtPt\\'d the unalienable rights of life, liherty a]l(l the pnrsni1 of ha.ppine\\'Ss. It is obvious today tha.t Amcri(·a lms <lcfaulted on this promissory note far as hP>r citi7.ens of co.Jo,r arr concP:rned. Instead of honoring ih1s sacn\\'d ohli,gation, America ha.s given the Nngro p0ople a bad check, a check which has come back marked \\'\\'insufficient fnnds.\\'\\' But we refus.e to helieve that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We rp.fnse to t.ha.t there are insufficient fuwls in the grea.t vaults of opportunity orf this nation. So we\\'ve come to cash this check, a check that will give ns upon oemand the rirhes of freedom and the s·ecurity of justice. \\\\Ve haYe a.bo come to this hallowed spot to remind Ame.rica of the fipJ·ce urgency of now. \\'l\\'hi:-; is no time to l\\'llgagc in the luxury of cooling off or to t.ake the quilizing dmg of graduali::;m. Now is the time to make real the of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark nnll clrsolate valley of segregation to the ,.unlit path of racial justi<·P. Now is the time to li.ft our uation from the quicksands of raeial injustice to the solid r()ek of brotherhood. Xow is t.he time to mak0 justice a reality for all of God\\'s children. It would be fatal for the nation to look the urgency of the moment. This swelt.ering summer of the i\\\\eg:ro\\'s legitimate disconte.nt. will not pass until there is .an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality -1963 is not an (md but a beginning. Tho>se who hope that tl1e Xegro needed to hlow off steam and will now be l\\'Olltent will ha\\\\·e a ruoP awakening if the na:tion return1\\'1 to as usua.I. \\'l\\'here will be 11eitht\\'T rest nor tranquility in Ame.rica until the Negro granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the tions of onr nation until the bright days of justice emerge. (Copyright 101i3, MARTI:-< Lt:THFR KIKc, JR.) And that is something that I mus.t say to my pBople who o.n the worn threshold whieh leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not he guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not \"eek to sati:sfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of biMe·n:le·s,s a.nd hatred. \\\\Ve must forever conduct our s.truggle on the high plane of dignity and diseiplin e. \\\\Ye must not allow our tive protests to degen e·rate into physical violence. Again and again we must ri se to the maje,stic heights of meding physical fo.rce wi.th soul for-ce. rl\\'he marvelous new tancy whi-ch has cn.gulfE>d the Negro community must not lead us to distrust all white people, for many o[ our white hrotlwrs, as evidcnccŁJ by the·ir prese.nce here today, have eome to realize tha.t their destiny is tied up with our They have come to re.alize that their freedom is extt·ieably hound t.o fre.room. \\\\\\\\\\'e cannot walk alone.

No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will nOit be fied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mig·hty stream. I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and t.ribulation. Some of you have eome fresh from narrow jail <!.ells. S ome of you have oome from are-as where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storm.s of persecution and staggered by 1hf\\' winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of erea tive suffering. Continue to work with the faith that un-earned suffering is redemptive.

Let us not wallow in the valley ot\\' des.pai·r. · I say to you today, my friends, though, even though we face the of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dl\\'e.am. I have a dream that one day this 11ation will rise up, live out the h·ue meaning of its creed: \"\"\\' e hold truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\" I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Geo·rgia of former slan\\' s and t.lw :-;ons of forml:\\'r will be able to sit do\\\\vn together at the table of brothehood. I have a dream that one day even the state of a state sweltering with the h eat of inJustice, (Copyright 19o.l. MARTI;\\'\\\\1 LuTHER KING, JR.) l\\'iweltering with the heat of oppression, will be !\\'ormed into an oasis of fre·edom and justice. I have a dream that my four little chi1dre!Il will one day live in a nation \\\\Vhere they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the conte·nt of the,ir cha.ra{!.te,r.l I have a dream ... I have a dream tha,t one day in AJ,abama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, one day right in Alabama little black boys a.nd black g.·ids will he abl e to join hands with lit.tle white boy\\'s and white girls as sisters anrl brothers. I have a dre·am today ...

This is onr hope. This is the faith that I go back to thC\\' South with. With this faith we will be to hew out of the mountain of de·spair a stone of hope. With this fait.h we ,,·ill he ahle to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony <;f brotherhood.
