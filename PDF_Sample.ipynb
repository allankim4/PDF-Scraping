Team 43\\n8.1 Monetha Team 43\\n8.2 Monetha Advisory Team 45\\nReferences 47\\n\\x0cExecutive summary\\n\\nE-commerce worldwide sales in 2014 were USD 1.33 trillion and are projected to\\nincrease to USD 4.058 trillion by 2020. E-commerce share of retail sales is expected\\nto increase from 7.4% in 2015 to 14.6% in 2020. Furthermore, according to Statista,\\nthe number of people buying goods or services online will increase from 1.46 billion\\nin 2015 to above 2 billion in 2020.\\n\\nDespite the explosive growth, three major problems still exist:\\n\\n1. Trust and reputation: Building trust is difficult, and it is centrally governed by\\nbig marketplaces. There is an inability to transfer trust from one centralized\\nservice to another, and thus a need to establish relationship with each\\nmerchant separately. Moreover, a merchant\\'s history is not recorded, so there\\nis no ability to punish fraudulent buyers or merchants. Huge efforts and\\nadvertising budgets are needed to create trust if a merchant is not a part of a\\ncentralized marketplace.\\n\\n2. Expensive and long payment process: There are 16(!) different steps to\\nsettle the transaction and up to 15(!) different fees to pay for payment\\ngateways. Transaction fees range from 2% + 0.1 to 6% + 0.7. Chargeback\\nfees of USD 15. Moreover, existing payment gateways rarely offer a simple\\nsolution for a merchant to accept mobile payments on their website or point of\\nsale terminals.\\n\\n3. An inability to reach the growing ethereum economy: Today, merchants\\ncannot accept payments in Ether, which has reached a market cap of USD\\n36bn as of June 14th. Moreover, a totally new digital asset class is being\\ncreated: tokens of products that are built on the Ethereum platform. The rise\\nof a new kind of digital assets enables the creation of a token-based digital\\nasset economy. It is expected that 10% of global GDP will be generated on\\nblockchains by 2025. Merchants will definitely want to participate in the\\nblockchain created economy.\\n\\nMonetha is creating a universal decentralized trust and reputation solution\\nworking flawlessly together with mobile payments processing on the\\nEthereum blockchain leveraging smart contract technology.\\n\\n1. Universal/Transferable trust and reputation system: Every time a\\n\\ntransaction is made the blockchain will record the time of the transaction, both\\nreceiving and sending wallet addresses, warranty conditions, delivery time,\\n\\nM\\n\\x0cand all other information that is typically needed to ensure trust. All the\\nsensitive information will be hashed and only available to authorized users in\\na beautifully designed user interface. Based on that information, clients and\\nmerchants will be able to file/solve a claim, rate each other, etc. Every time a\\ntransaction is made, claim registered, solved or unsolved (according to\\nthe purchase details saved during the purchase), review written, etc., the\\nsmart contract will automatically change the trust level for each of the\\nparties involved.\\n\\n2. Mobile payments solution: With the help of the Ethereum blockchain, we\\nare able to make payments with only 1 step and 1 fee, which results in\\naccepting payments generally up to 5X cheaper and up to x10000 faster for\\nmerchants. After simple integration with Monetha, merchants will be able to:\\nuse our decentralized trust and reputation system, accept Ethereum based\\ntokens, accept mobile payments, and easily convert cryptocurrency to their\\nlocal fiat currency.\\n\\n3. Enabling merchants to reach $10 trillion digital asset economy: By\\ndeveloping Monetha, we will not only allow merchants to participate ina\\ntrustful decentralized economy, but also reach the growing digital asset\\neconomy through our payment solution. The World Bank estimates that 10%\\nof global GDP will be generated on blockchains by 2025. The GDP estimated\\nfor 2025 is $100T, thus the value generated through blockchain is expected to\\nbe $10T (10%).\\n\\nMobile payments: According to Boston Consulting Group, the payment industry is\\nabout to experience a huge shift towards mobile payments: 1) In 2015 mobile\\npayment volume was USD 8.6 billion in the US. It is expected to increase almost 32x\\nby 2021 to reach $274bn in the US alone, 2) mobile share of total ecommerce is\\nexpected to increase to 48.5% of total e-commerce by 2020. It was 23.6% in 2015.\\n\\nBusiness model: Monetha will only have one fee \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a 1.5% transaction fee for\\nmerchants.\\n\\nToken and token ecosystem: A % of Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revenue will be put in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVoucher\\nSmart Contract\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in a form of MTH tokens to our token holders with an ability to claim for a\\nvoucher proportionately to the amount of MTH tokens they hold. Token holders will receive a\\nvoucher in MTH (Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s currency) to use it as a discount when buying from Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmerchants. This voucher would be proportional to the amount of the MTH tokens held.\\n\\nLoyalty program: In order to encourage a network effect and create an ecosystem\\nfor the Monetha token, we are going to introduce a loyalty program for merchants.\\n\\nM\\n\\x0cEvery purchase made via the Monetha payment system will reward the client of the\\nmerchant with 0.2% (the exact percentage might change over time) of the value of\\nthe transaction in Monetha tokens from the Monetha loyalty pool.\\n\\n1. Three significant problems that merchants\\nface: trust and reputation, payments, and an\\ninability to reach the growing Ethereum\\neconomy\\n\\nE-commerce has grown at an unprecedented rate and is projected to grow at an\\neven higher rate over the coming years. According to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStatista\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, retail e-commerce\\n\\nsales worldwide in 2014 were USD 1.33 trillion and are projected to increase to USD\\n4.058 trillion by 2020.\\n\\n5,000\\n\\n4,058\\n\\nQ 4,000\\ng 3,418\\n3 3,000 2,860\\ns\\n8 2,352\\n3 2,000 1915\\n: 1,336 1,548\\n5\\na a\\n\\n: 2014 2015 2016 2017* 2018* 2019* 2020*\\n\\nThe growth is perfectly illustrated by the number of shops created on the Shopify\\nplatform. They had 84,000 shops in 2013, 144,000 in 2014, 243,000 in 2015 and\\nended 2016 with almost 378,000 merchants on the platform - a growth of 450% over\\n3 years.\\n\\nM\\n\\x0cE-commerce is also gaining greater weight in total retail sales globally. It is expected\\nto increase from 7.4% in 2015 to 14.6% in 2020. Furthermore, according to Statista,\\nthe number of people buying goods or services online will increase from 1.46 billion\\n\\nin 2015 to above 2 billion in 2020.\\n\\nDespite the super high growth of e-commerce, merchants face three major\\n\\nproblems: 1) Trust and reputation, 2) Expensive and long payment process, and\\n3) An inability to reach the growing Ethereum ecosystem, with a market cap of\\n~36 billion and its corresponding Ethereum token economy.\\n\\n1.1 Trust and reputation problem in global e-commerce\\n\\nBuilding trust is difficult. It takes time and costs a lot of money. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even more difficult\\nfor new or small merchants.\\n\\nTrust and reputation are extremely important for participants of today\\'s global\\ncommerce. People are more likely to buy from trusted merchants; therefore,\\nmerchants are striving to maximise their trust rating/reputation and build a loyal\\ncustomer base.\\n\\nAccording to Econsultancy, 61% of customers read online reviews before making a\\npurchase decision. Moreover, according to Reevo stats, 63% of customers are more\\nlikely to make a purchase from a site which has user reviews and a proven trust\\nrating.\\n\\nConsumer reviews are significantly more trusted (nearly 12 times more) than\\ndescriptions that come from manufacturers, according to a survey of US internet\\nusers by the online video review site EXPO. Furthermore, Shopify, in one of their\\nmerchant blogs, emphasized that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshowing that others trust you\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is vital toa\\nmerchant\\'s success.\\n\\nThere are, however, a few major problems regarding trust that merchants face in\\ntoday\\'s global e-commerce.\\n\\n1. The trust and reputation system to facilitate commerce is only possible in closed\\nmarketplaces, which are controlled by a central authority. In order to build trust, you\\nhave to join one or a few of the closed marketplaces, such as: Amazon, Ebay,\\nAlibaba, etc. By joining them, merchant must accept all their rules; for example, 20%\\ncommission from sales.\\n\\nM\\n\\x0c2. Merchants have no ability to transfer their trust rate from one centralized\\nservice to another. For example, once you become trusted on Amazon, you still must\\nbuild your trust on Ebay or another marketplace.\\n\\n3. Merchants have to invest considerable effort and finance into their brand and\\nadvertising if they do not want to join the centralized marketplace that facilitates\\ntrust and reputation.\\n\\n4. Buyers need to establish a relationship with each merchant separately.\\nMoreover, a buyer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history is not available for merchants to make decisions. Being\\ntrusted with one merchant doesn\\'t mean you are trusted with another.\\n\\n5. There is no ability to punish fraudulent buyers or merchants and reflect that in their\\nhistory. Most fraud happens due to stolen cards or stolen credit card information. In\\n2015, card fraud reached $21.84 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a figure that is expected to rise to $31.67\\nbillion by 2020. According to Advanced Payment Report 2016 conducted with the\\nhelp of Wirecard.de, 92% of merchants say fraud will remain a prime concern for\\nonline payments. Large e-commerce and m-commerce merchants lose 1.4% and\\n1.7% of revenues respectively to fraud according to the 2015 True Cost of Fraud\\nStudy.\\n\\nThere are millions of e-commerce merchants outside closed marketplaces that need\\na universal trust and reputation system in order to be trusted by their clients.\\n\\nIn order to build global trust in e-commerce, we need a universal trust and\\nreputation system. Payments and commerce using Monetha will be done directly\\nbetween two unknown parties using a much-needed decentralized, smart contract\\nbased, trust and reputation system.\\n\\n1.2 Expensive and long payment process\\n\\nDespite having a wide variety of different payment gateways and processing\\ncompanies, the following major problems still exist for merchants:\\n\\ne Costly and complex transaction settlements with up to 16(!) steps to accept\\nand settle transactions.\\n\\ne Up to 15(!) different type of fees including a transaction fee of between 2%\\nto 6%, and a chargeback fee of USD 20.\\n\\ne Extremely high cross-border transaction fees.\\n\\ne Long transaction times ranging from 2 days to several weeks to receive their\\nmoney. E-commerce payment processors often hold merchants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 money for a\\nweek due to higher probability of chargebacks during first week after\\n\\nM\\n\\x0c1.2.1\\n\\npurchase.\\n\\nMobile payments. Mobile payment solutions are fragmented and not available\\nuniversally or simply not easy to use despite a strong consumer appetite to\\nleverage them. Payment processors rarely offer a simple solution for a\\nmerchant to accept mobile payments.\\n\\nCurrent payment process\\n\\nThe picture below describes the payment confirmation or rejection in 8 steps at the\\ntime of payment regardless of it being in a physical store, e-commerce or\\nm-commerce. The process is complex and includes 8 additional steps to settle the\\ntransaction. In total, you have 16 steps for money to be transferred from the client\\'s\\nbank account to the merchant\\'s bank account.\\n\\n1.2.2\\n\\n  \\n\\nVISA\\n\\xc2\\xa9\\n\\nor PR OH\\n\\n \\n\\nCustomer presents the Amounts tanamted to Payment cessing Sevie Provider Aocition ends\\ncet card.

For example: every\\ntime someone makes a transaction for USD 10, the merchant on average\\npays => 10*((0.02+0.06)/2) + ((0.1+0.7)/2)) = USD 0.8 for banks, credit card\\nassociations, payment gateways and processors.\\n\\nRetrieval Request Fee and Chargeback Fee are paid when someone claims\\nfor a chargeback. The best-known payment gateways such as PayPal and\\nStripe charge merchants a USD 15 chargeback fee. In addition to the\\nchargeback fee, there is work to be done by the retailer to prove the\\n\\nM\\n\\x0ctransaction was done respecting the rules. This costs time and money. When\\nthe info is missing, the charge is reversed even if it was legit.\\n\\ne Flat fees include: Terminal fees to buy the needed terminal for retail\\nmerchants, PCI fees paid to Payment Card industry for compliance OR\\nnoncompliance, and others, such as: Annual fees, Monthly fees, Monthly\\nminimum fees, IRS reporting fees, network fees, etc.\\n\\ne Incidental fees that consist of: Address Verification Service (AVS), Voice\\nAuthorization Fee (VAF), Batch Fee, and NFS fee.\\n\\ne Cross-border fees. PayPal, for example, charges the merchant a transaction\\nfee of 4.4% + fixed fee (depends on the currency), instead of 2.9% + fixed fee\\n(depends on the currency) if the funds the merchant is receiving comes from\\noutside of the U.S.\\n\\nFinally, some payment gateways and/or processing companies like to keep their fee\\nstructure hidden or totally incomprehensible to the average merchant.\\n\\n1.2.3 Long fund transfer time\\n\\nAs there are a lot of different parties involved in moving the money from one bank\\naccount to another (or from one country to another), it often takes up 3 days to\\nsettle the transaction. For international payments, it can take up to a week or\\neven more. Moreover, payment gateways more often than not hold your money for a\\nweek.\\n\\nThat often causes cash flow problems for small merchants.\\n\\n1.2.4 Mobile payments\\n\\nAccording to StatCounter, October 2016 was the first ever month in the history when\\nmore users around the world accessed the internet from mobile devices than from\\ndesktop computers. Of all users, 51.3% used mobile devices while 48.7% used\\ncomputers. Moreover, according to Statista, approximately 80% of internet usage\\nwill be mobile by 2018. At the same time, mobile payments are projected to\\nincrease from USD 8.6bn in 2015 to USD 274bn in 2021.\\n\\nThe problem is that most e-commerce and retail payment gateways and/or terminals\\n\\nwere developed to accept and process payments using physical credit cards, and at\\ntheir core, cards are not mobile-friendly. Payment gateways rarely offer a simple\\n\\nM\\n\\x0csolution for a merchant to accept mobile payments in their website or point of sale\\nterminals.\\n\\n1.3 An inability to participate in token-enabled digital asset\\neconomy potentially worth $10T in 2025.\\n\\nThe market cap of all the Ethereum tokens is growing extraordinarily fast. Ether\\nreached a market cap of USD 36bn as of June 14th. But most importantly, a totally\\nnew market of digital assets is being created: tokens of projects that are built on\\nEthereum platform. The rise of new kind of digital assets enables the creation of a\\ntoken-based digital asset economy.\\n\\nA correspondent of Bloomberg talks about it here, starting from 2:00.\\n\\nThe World Bank estimates that 10% of global GDP will be generated on blockchains\\nby 2025. The GDP estimated for 2025 is $100T, thus the value generated through\\nblockchain is expected to be $10T (10%).\\n\\nToday, merchants don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have an opportunity to access that money. They will have a\\nconsiderable incentive to participate in the token economy within the next few years.\\n\\n2. Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s solution: a decentralized trust and\\nreputation system working flawlessly together\\nthrough a blockchain based payment gateway\\n\\nWe are creating a decentralized payment and trust solution on the Ethereum\\nblockchain leveraging smart contract technology. The payment solution works\\nflawlessly together with our decentralized trust and reputation system. Merchants will\\nbe able to accept Ethereum based cryptocurrencies and exchange them with\\ntraditional (fiat) currencies. Merchants and customers will participate in global\\ndecentralized commerce with total trust.\\n\\nMonetha is on a mission to:\\n\\ne Develop a global decentralized trust and reputation system for tomorrow\\'s\\nglobal e-commerce.\\n\\nM\\n\\x0ce Make the payment process simple and efficient: only one step.\\n\\ne Make accepting payments for merchants generally up to 5x cheaper and up\\nto 10,000 times faster.\\n\\ne Provide an opportunity for merchants to accept mobile payments.\\n\\ne Bring the Ethereum-based token economy to the mainstream.\\n\\ne Expand Ethereum real-world application infrastructure.\\n\\nIn simple words: our mission is to develop and deploy the best transaction system that\\nwould be based on enforceable contracts without third party between consumer and\\nmerchants and a strong decentralised reputation management system. Transaction\\nand fund transfer will be done in one step together with the enforceable sale\\ncontract. Transaction fees would be simplified from many to a simple transaction fee\\nwherever the consumer and merchants are located on the planet.\\n\\n2.1 A Universal Decentralized Trust and Reputation System on\\nthe Ethereum blockchain. Ensuring trust in global commerce.\\n\\nBuilding trust is difficult because:\\n\\ne Merchants need to become part of a centrally governed marketplace, like\\nAmazon, Ebay, Alibaba, Etsy, etc, where they must pay a sales commission.\\n\\ne Merchants cannot transfer their trust from one centralized service to another.\\n\\ne Merchants need to invest huge efforts and budgets into brand and advertising\\nif not being part of centralized marketplace.\\n\\ne Complicated conflict management using existing system.\\n\\ne Buyers need to establish a relationship with each merchant separately and\\ntheir history is not transparent.\\n\\ne There is no ability to punish fraudulent buyers or merchants and reflect that in\\ntheir history.\\n\\nMonetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trust and reputation system will be universal, transparent,\\ntransferable, self-executing, not controlled by a central authority, and working\\nflawlessly together with a payment solution.\\n\\n2.1.1 How it works\\n\\nEvery time a transaction is made, no matter if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s retail or e-commerce, the\\nblockchain will save the time of the transaction, both the receiving and sending\\naddresses, warranty conditions, delivery time, and all other information that is\\ntypically needed to ensure the trust. All the sensitive information will be hashed and\\nonly available to authorized users in a beautifully designed user interface. Based on\\n\\nM\\n\\n10\\n\\x0cthat information, clients and merchants will be able to file/solve a claim, rate each\\nother, etc.\\n\\nDefault trust rates will be created for both merchant and client using the Monetha\\necosystem for the first time. A Trust rating will be assigned to a specific wallet\\naddress. Every time a transaction is made, claim registered, solved or unsolved\\n(according to the purchase details saved during the purchase), review written,\\netc., the smart contract will automatically change the trust level for each of the\\nparties involved.\\n\\nThe merchant trust rating\\n\\nOnce the merchant starts accepting mobile Ethereum based currency payments\\nusing Monetha, a default trust rating will be created. Smart contract will automatically\\nchange the trust rating according to the behavior of the merchant. For example:\\n\\ne Does the merchant react to claims from clients?\\n\\ne Does the merchant react quickly to claims from clients?\\n\\ne Doclients rate the merchant for delivering products as promised: on time, as\\nadvertised and in good quality?\\n\\ne Does the merchant have good reviews from clients?\\n\\nDifferent weights will be assigned to different actions.\\n\\nThe trust rating will be visible to everyone in the most common and typical places,\\nsuch as the footer of the merchant\\'s website or mobile app. The only way the\\nmerchant can increase the trust rating is by providing products or services as\\nadvertised and in good condition.\\n\\nTrust client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trust rating\\n\\nThe main reason to create a trust rating for the client is to decrease the likelihood of\\nfraudulent buyers and offer loyalty features for trustful buyers.\\n\\nOnce a client buys something from a merchant using Monetha for the first time, the\\ndefault trust rating for that client will be automatically created and linked to the wallet\\naddress of that client.\\n\\nThe client trust rating will be updated automatically by the smart contract based on\\nhis or her behavior. Different weights will be assigned to different actions. For\\nexample:\\n\\nM\\n\\n11\\n\\x0cWhat is the client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim history?\\n\\nHow many claims has the user made? Are those claims being resolved?\\nHave all the previous claims been solved with merchants?\\n\\nPurchase history: behavior, frequency, etc.\\n\\nThe trust rate of the client will be available to see on the blockchain and visible in a\\nuser-friendly interface to merchants once the purchase is made.\\n\\nThe client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trust rating will be visible on the blockchain or in Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mobile app.\\n\\nIn totally decentralized e-commerce, it is important that merchants have information\\nabout the client. The most important thing for a merchant is to avoid someone who\\ndoes hazardous things on purpose. If that happens, the merchant will be able to\\ndecrease the client\\'s trust rating significantly. Based on that information, other\\nmerchants will be able to decide whether they want to sell products to a client with a\\nlow trust rating.\\n\\nClaims, reviews and conflict management.\\n\\nEvery purchase will be saved on the blockchain together with the time of the\\ntransaction, both receiving and sending addresses, warranty conditions, estimated\\ndelivery date, the product that was bought and all other information that is typically\\nneeded to ensure trust.\\n\\nThe following information will be available to both parties:\\n\\ne The merchant will have all the information about every transaction with the\\nabove-mentioned details in his profile in the Monetha system.\\n\\ne The client will be able to see all his purchases together with the\\nabove-mentioned details only in his profile within the Monetha mobile app.\\n\\nBased on that information, parties will have an opportunity to file/resolve claims,\\nreview, and rate each other in a transparent way. Smart contract will automatically\\ndecrease or increase the trust rating. That kind of management of conflict resolution\\nthrough smart contracts will help each party to deal with the situation faster, easier\\nand cheaper (no chargeback fees for the merchant).\\n\\nExamples:\\n1. Claim. Once the client makes a purchase, all the needed information is saved\\n\\nto the blockchain. In order to see that information, the client must download\\nthe Monetha app. Once he logs in, he sees all the purchases he made with a\\n\\nM\\n\\n12\\n\\x0cparticular wallet address anywhere using Monetha as a payment gateway.\\nThe client selects the particular purchase he is not happy about, and initiates\\na claim by providing the details of the claim, e.g., the product is broken. The\\nmerchant\\'s trust rating is immediately decreased, so the merchant is\\nincentivized to solve the problem as quickly as possible. The merchant\\nreceives the notification about the claim, looks at the details and contacts the\\nclient off-chain. Client and merchant agree on the solution and one of the\\nparties initiates a resolution by pressing the \"Claim resolved\" button in the\\nmobile app or the merchant system. Details of how the situation was resolved\\n(product changed, money returned, etc.) must be provided as well. The details\\nare saved to the blockchain. The other party gets the notification, reads the\\ndetails and agrees by pressing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClaim resolved\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Once the claim is resolved,\\ntrust rating is increased for both parties instantly.\\n\\n. Reviews. Clients and merchants will be able to write reviews about each\\nother. Written reviews will have more weight on each other\\'s trust rating than\\njust \\xe2\\x80\\x9csilent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d transactions without a review. For example, a client\\'s review about\\na good product and customer service will increase the merchant\\'s trust rating\\nmore than just a simple \\xe2\\x80\\x9csilent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d transaction without writing a review. Reviews\\nabout the merchant will be visible in the mobile app for a client. Merchants will\\nsee the reviews clients have written about them in their system. All reviews,\\ngood and bad, will be automatically reflected in the trust rating of the\\nclient and the merchant.\\n\\n. Sales contracts. A merchant can propose a 15 day return policy - no\\nquestions asked. This merchant will be in a better position to sell than the one\\nwho does not offer a return policy. These rules will be published by the\\nmerchant. Smart contract will ensure merchants and consumers are\\nrespecting their commitments to each other and the rating system will reflect\\nthat.\\n\\n2.1.2 How the likelihood of fraud is reduced with a global decentralized\\nreputation and trust system\\n\\nThe trust rate will be available and visible to everyone in the ecosystem so that\\nparties are incentivized to increase their trust rating, which will enable better\\ndecision-making and a safer e-commerce environment. Moreover, we will offer\\nincentives such as a reduced transaction fee, faster transaction times, etc., for those\\nwho hold higher ratings and proven history. This level of transparency could\\ndecrease fraud significantly or at least make it more difficult.\\n\\nM\\n\\n13\\n\\x0cTo illustrate this point, Kevin Kelly, the author of a book titled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOut of Control\\xe2\\x80\\x99, wrote:\\n\\nA pretty good society needs more than just anonymity. An online\\ncivilization requires online anonymity, online identification, online\\nauthentication, online reputations, online trust holders, online\\nSignatures, online privacy, and online access. All are essential\\ningredients of any open society.\\n\\nWe bring this to the next level. We want to create a transferable trust system so that\\nevery merchant, big and small, retail or e-commerce, will be able to join a\\nglobal decentralized trust rating system by accepting mobile payments with\\nMonetha.\\n\\n2.2 A mobile payments solution to accept mobile Ethereum\\nbased cryptocurrency payments generally up to 5X cheaper\\nand up to x10000 faster.\\n\\nAfter simple integration with Monetha, merchants will be able to:\\n\\ne Use our decentralized trust and reputation system.\\ne Accept Ethereum based tokens.\\ne Easily convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency.\\n\\n2.2.1 How it works: e-commerce example\\n\\nClients will pick their items, add them to the cart and select that they will pay through\\nthe Monetha gateway instead of other available options such as credit card or\\nPayPal.\\n\\nThe amount needed to pay is converted to the selected Ethereum based currency\\n(token) from traditional currency in real-time. A QR code is generated which the\\nclient scans with any crypto wallet on his mobile app and presses \\xe2\\x80\\x9csend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Money\\narrives in merchant\\'s smart contract wallet in approximately 2 minutes. The amount\\nof Ethereum based currency received is exchanged to a merchant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s preferred fiat\\ncurrency according to the merchant\\'s preference via Kraken or another crypto\\nexchange API. Merchants will be able to choose the frequency at which crypto\\ntokens are converted to fiat, the local currency to exchange to, time of sending\\nmoney to their bank account, and many other options.\\n\\nM\\n\\n14\\n\\x0cMonetha is easy, fast, cheap, and guaranteed by smart contracts.\\nHow merchant payment fees and transaction time are resolved\\n\\nThe picture below shows how blockchain changes the method of payment. The\\ntransaction goes from customer to merchant directly; ditching all the intermediaries in\\nthe process and saving merchants a huge amount of time and money. There is no\\nneed to close or settle anything for merchant anymore. The settlement and closing\\nhappens at the same time as the transaction. There is only 1 step instead of 16!\\n\\nAs the payment now goes directly from the client to merchant, instead of waiting for\\nup to 2 weeks to see the funds, it arrives approximately 2 minutes after the\\npurchase no matter where in the world the purchase was made.\\n\\nAs far as payment fees are concerned, instead of 15 types of fees merchants may\\npay using a standard payment gateway; with Monetha, they will have only 1 fee: a\\ntransaction fee of 1.5%.\\n\\nThe chargeback fee goes away as well. Once the merchant agrees to send the\\nmoney back, they just send the money back and pay the transaction fee. No\\nridiculously high chargeback fees anymore. In addition, the pain (time and money to\\nprove the transaction is legit) is gone. Moreover, the decentralized trust and\\nreputation system helps to decrease the rate of fraudulent payments as well.\\n\\nUltimately, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up to x5 cheaper and up to x10000 faster for merchants to accept\\npayments with Monetha: with a transparent fee structure with no chargeback or\\nhidden fees, and a beautiful user interface with smart contract enabled wallet\\nsecurity.\\n\\n15\\n\\x0c  \\n   \\n\\ne- Clients bank\\n\\nMerchants bank\\n- x.\\nCredit card network\\ni.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\nCredit card network\\nv\\n\\n     \\n     \\n\\nv\\nen\\nee\\n\\nNonead of settlement and closing of account\\n\\nSmart contract based wallet for merchants\\n\\nThe merchant\\'s account acts as the equivalent of a bank account that stores funds\\nand enforces security. The crucial fact here is that it\\'s only controlled by the user, the\\nmerchant. Today, banks hold higher authority because they run the database that\\npoints at the database entry which says you have that money and you have to trust\\nthat your money is safe. Banks own the control of that database and authority to\\ngrant or deny the access to the money they hold. Not anymore.\\n\\nMonetha will not be able to suspend, hold or prevent any transaction. Instead,\\npermissionless transactions will be guaranteed by the smart contract. Instantly, and\\nas promised. No more headache of not knowing where the merchant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money is and\\nwhy it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being withheld.\\n\\nMerchants can customize their settings to fit their preferences, such as:\\n\\ne How much funds to exchange with the local currency.\\ne How often to exchange.\\ne Others.\\n\\nWith Monetha, we are giving control of merchant funds back into their own hands\\nand giving them easy-to-manage control of their funds received from selling goods or\\nservices which is safeguarded by the security of smart contracts. Now, merchants\\n\\nM\\n\\n16\\n\\x0ccan have better security and substantially improved usability.\\nIt is literally a merchant becoming his own bank.\\n\\n2.2.2 Case studies: merchant fees and transaction time\\nMerchant fees\\n\\nJohn is the owner of a small e-commerce store selling T-shirts for USD 10. He was\\nalways frustrated by the transactions fees he paid to the banks and other\\nintermediaries.\\n\\nOne day, he found out about Monetha through a financial news article and decided\\nto try it out. It took him only a few minutes to get started. Now the transaction money\\ngoes directly from the client to his account. That means that from now on, John will\\nnot only be able to accept mobile payments, but also, more importantly, instead of\\npaying every intermediary in the payment process from 2%+0.1 up to 6%+0.7 per\\ntransaction, John now pays only 1.5% per transaction. So instead of paying EUR 0,8\\non average every time someone buys a T-shirt, John will now only pay EUR 0,15\\nper transaction using Monetha as his mobile payments processor. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 5x times\\ncheaper on average!\\n\\nMoreover, Monetha exchanges Ethereum based currencies with his local currency\\nand sends the money to his bank according to predefined settings: upon his request\\nor automatically.\\n\\nTransaction time and cash flow problems. E-commerce merchant.\\n\\nPeter has a website where he sells various home appliances to customers all around\\nthe globe for almost 12 years now. He knows money is just a digit that must be\\nexchanged once the transaction is made. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why he cannot believe how long it\\ntakes for him to receive the funds after a client places an order.\\n\\nIf the client is local, the funds show up in his bank account in up to 2-3 days. But if\\nthe client is from the other side of the world, it may take up to 2 weeks for funds to\\nshow up his bank account. He has to trust the client and the banks and ship the\\nproduct before he receives the funds. Moreover, the payment gateway often holds\\nthe money for a week. Because of the time it takes for him to receive the money, he\\noften experiences cash flow problems and, consequently, is not able to pay\\nhis suppliers.\\n\\nOne day, a friend of Peter told him about Monetha. The friend told him that it takes\\n\\nM\\n\\n17\\n\\x0cup to 2 minutes to receive money with Monetha after a purchase was made. With\\nMonetha, Peter can accept mobile payments and receive funds instantly no\\nmatter where the client is after the purchase is made. He no longer has to trust\\nbanks, payment gateways or PDF files generated as a proof of payment that clients\\nsend him. Furthermore, Monetha solved his cash flow problems instantly. He\\nreceives funds, can ship products instantly and order more shoes without a fear of\\nnot being able to pay.\\n\\n2.3 Enabling merchants to reach $10 trillion digital asset\\neconomy\\n\\nBy developing Monetha, we will not only allow merchants to participate in a trustful\\ndecentralized economy, but also reach the growing digital asset economy through\\nour payment solution.\\n\\n2.3.1 Growth of Ether as a currency and the Ethereum ecosystem\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndigital token economy\\n\\nAs shown above, a correspondent for Bloomberg talks about Ethereum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s potential\\nhere, starting from 2:00.\\n\\nEthereum is a platform that enables the creation of decentralised applications. As a\\nresult, it has facilitated the emergence of a new and exclusively digital asset class:\\ntokens. As discussed above, the World Bank estimates that 10% of global GDP,\\nwhich is approximately $10T, will go through blockchains in 2025.\\n\\nTo illustrate the fact, let us look at the graph below showing the growth of altcoins.\\n\\nThis growth is influenced by the ascendency of Ether as a currency and the\\nexpansion of Ethereum-based tokens.\\n\\n18\\n\\x0cCryptocurrency Market Caps (hostorical)\\n\\nsso,\\nseo\\nsou\\nssx0um\\n\\n19000\\n\\n2 + 7 \\xc2\\xa2 7 : \\' :\\ng i i : i 8 5 5 z \\xe2\\x80\\x98 \\xc2\\xa3 a\\nB A 5 a 5 a a 5\\n\\nThe graph below shows the growth of Ether\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market cap.

Monetha servers generate a QR code with all\\nthe needed underlying order information such as order number, price, currency,\\nwarranty, delivery option, etc. The client must scan the code during a defined time\\nlimit otherwise he needs to re-initiate payment.

Market opportunity and business model\\n\\nThe global e-commerce market size in 2016 was USD 1.9 trillion and is expected to\\nrise to USD 4 trillion in 2020. At the same time, the global retail payments industry\\nwas worth USD 16 trillion in 2015. It is estimated to increase to USD 21 trillion in\\n2020. Global payment revenue was USD 1.8 trillion in 2015 and should reach USD\\n2.2 trillion in 2020.\\n\\nAccording to Boston Consulting Group, the payment industry is about to experience\\na huge shift towards mobile payments:\\ne Mobile payment volume was USD 8.6 billion in the US. It is expected to\\nincrease tenfold by 2021 to reach $274bn only in US.\\ne Mobile share of total ecommerce is expected to increase to 48.5% of total\\ne-commerce by 2020. It was 23.6% in 2015.\\ne Merchant mobile payment acceptance network to grow 10X by 2020.\\n\\n4.1 Market opportunity\\n\\n4.2.1 Explosive growth of E-commerce\\n\\nAccording to Statista, retail e-commerce sales worldwide in 2014 were USD 1.33\\ntrillion and are projected to increase to USD 4.058 trillion by 2020.\\n\\nThe growth is perfectly illustrated by the number of shops created on Shopify\\nplatform.

However, in a breakout scenario, given a possible\\ndisruption by convenience, security and Internet of Things, the growth rate of mobile\\nand digital payments could be even higher.\\n\\n4.1.3 Transaction volume and global payment revenues\\n\\nThe payments industry is enormously big. The total value of global retail payments\\ntransactions was estimated at USD 16 trillion in 2015. This is estimated to increase\\nto USD 21 trillion by 2020. The estimation comprised consumer-to-merchant\\ntransactions across retail verticals such as food and grocery, apparel, consumer\\ndurables etc. Digital payments contributed to 8 percent, which is USD 1.26\\ntrillion, of the overall global retail payments market in 2015 and is projected to\\nincrease to 18-24 percent by 2020, which is USD 6.3 trillion.\\n\\nThe global payments revenue market size is approximately USD 2 trillion and\\nsteadily rising. In most cases, global payments are the payments revenues that\\ninclude direct and indirect revenues generated by non-cash payment services\\n\\nM\\n\\n30\\n\\x0c(excluding interbank transfers). Simply speaking, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the total revenues collected by\\nfinancial services companies around the globe.\\n\\nAs shown in the graph, the global payment revenues should reach USD 2.2 trillion\\nover the upcoming few years.\\n\\nPayments revenue,\\n$ trillion!\\n\\n  \\n   \\n \\n\\n+9% 212\\n\\n \\n\\nof\\n\\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2020F\\n\\n4.2 Business model\\n\\nMonetha will charge a 1.5% transaction fee from merchants.

This 0.25% + 0.1 is a\\nmark-up fee to the interchange rates.\\n\\nFor example, if the total transaction fee that merchant is charged is 2.35% + $0.2,\\nthe 2.1%+ $0.2 is the interchange part that banks, credit card associations and\\nothers are dividing and 0.25% + $0.1 is the markup part, which payment gateways\\ntake home as revenue. We not only decrease the transaction fee that merchant has\\nto pay, let alone the other fees that he will not have to worry about anymore, but we\\nare also left with approximately four times the rate to do business with.\\n\\nM\\n\\n31\\n\\x0c5. Marketing and Strategy\\n5.1 Network effect\\n\\nOur strategy is focused on creating a network effect as our decentralized trust and\\nreputation system enables us to do that. Moreover, we will use the well-known\\nbowling pin strategy: start with a niche market (stage 2: existing crypto community),\\nand then move to other niches and broader markets.\\n\\nStage 1. In our case, we are focusing on the supply side first: being accepted in as\\nmany locations as fast as possible through partnerships that enables instant scale.\\nTo achieve that, we will partner with payment providers that can give us instant\\nscale. We are already in positive talks with major players, Revel Systems and\\nShopify, being the biggest (as of the end of 2016, Shopify had over 377K merchants\\non its platform).\\n\\nStage 2. Educate the initial client base in the existing crypto community. Main value\\npropositions: decentralized trust system, no need to pay credit card network fees, no\\nspending limit.\\n\\nStage 3. Broader market adoption:\\n\\n1. Once again: supply side first. Monetha is accepted in even more\\nlocations globally.\\n\\n2. Education of general public. Supply increases exposure and people are\\nwilling to buy more from trusted merchants. Only Merchants accepting\\npayments through Monetha will be guaranteed to be trustful by\\ndecentralized reputation and trust system.\\n\\n3. Once there are more people willing to pay with their mobile phones at\\ntrusted merchants, more merchants will join the network.\\n\\nNetwork effect is very well illustrated by Metcalfe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Law. For example: one\\ntelephone is useless. Two people with telephones can only make one connection,\\nwhile five telephones make 10 connections and twelve telephones make 66\\nconnections.\\n\\nV alue of a network = n(n-1)/2, where n is number of people using the network\\n\\nFocusing on the supply side first drives the demand which in turn drives the supply.\\nNetwork effect kicks in: the more users there are, the more valuable it is. This\\nrapid adoption is then self-perpetuating as both sides value the access to a bigger\\nnetwork of users (read \\xe2\\x80\\x98more choice\\xe2\\x80\\x99, \\xe2\\x80\\x98higher probability of finding a match\\xe2\\x80\\x99) coupled\\n\\nM\\n\\n32\\n\\x0cwith the improved transaction experience.\\n\\nThe importance of network effect was very well described by the Vice President of\\nBessemer Venture Partners (investors are LinkedIn, Shopify, etc.) in this LinkedIn\\npost:\\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/winning-marketplace-importance-supply-side-raghav-\\nbahl\\n\\nThe growth of the ecosystem following those steps is illustrated in the graph below.\\nThat is how, in most cases, marketplaces and ecosystems are being built.\\n\\ny) \\\\)\\n\\nY wo\\n\\n5.2 Loyalty program\\n\\nIn order to encourage networks effects and create an ecosystem for Monetha token,\\nwe are going to introduce a loyalty program for clients. That is unprecedented as\\nmost loyalty programs are facilitated by merchants themselves and not payment\\nproviders.\\n\\n5.1.1 How does the loyalty program work?\\n\\ne Every purchase made via the Monetha payment system will reward the client\\nwith 0.2% (the percentage might change over time) of the value of the\\ntransaction in Monetha tokens from the Monetha loyalty pool. This is provided\\n\\nM\\n\\n33\\n\\x0cby Monetha no matter what goods or services the client buys or where the\\nmerchant and client are based.\\n\\ne Loyalty tokens can be used during any purchase using a Monetha wallet:\\no The client picks an item he/she wants to buy\\n0 If the client has Monetha tokens she/he can apply them to reduce the\\nitems cost. The client gets a discount.\\no Monetha tokens are converted to ETH in real time.\\no Monetha tokens are returned to Monetha loyalty pool.\\no Monetha platform covers a discount for the merchant, so he gets the\\nfull item price.\\no Monetha tokens can be applied for up to 70% of the purchase value.\\no The client is still getting 0.2% of the amount paid by ETH (or other\\ncryptocurrency) after loyalty is applied.\\ne Tokens acquired in this way are eligible for a discount for 6 months. Unused\\ntokens are returned back to Monetha loyalty token pool.\\ne The client cannot convert tokens exchanged in this way to any crypto or fiat\\ncurrency.\\ne The merchant is able to provide bigger loyalty discounts for his clients by\\nadjusting his loyalty settings in merchants interface.\\ne Clients with high trust are eligible for higher discount percentage than 0.2%.\\ne The exact percentage of loyalty MTH tokens granted with every purchase\\nmight change over time.\\n\\n34\\n\\x0c6. Crowdsale details\\n\\nThe Monetha crowdsale and the corresponding token creation process will be issued\\nby Monetha GmbH, a Swiss Limited Liability Company, and will be organized around\\nsmart contracts running on Ethereum. Participants willing to support the\\n\\ndevelopment of the Monetha Project can do so by sending Ether currency to the\\ndesignated address. By doing so, they are purchasing Monetha Tokens (MTH) at the\\nrate of 2 000 MTH per 1 ETH which are sent instantly to their wallet.\\n\\ne The accepted currency during the ICO is Ether.\\n\\ne The creation will be capped (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSoft Cap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) upon receipt of ETH equivalent to\\nEUR 7m (fixed on 28000 ETH). This amount is subject to change before the\\nToken Creation event.\\n\\ne The Token Creation period will last 31 (thirty one) days, if Soft Cap is not\\nreached sooner.\\n\\ne Ifthe Soft Cap is reached before the end of 31 (thirty one) days, additional\\ncontributions will be accepted for 120 hours in case some contributors missed\\nthe very short window for MTH creation.\\n\\ne If the Crowdsale campaign does not reach its minimal capital goal of EUR\\n700.000 (fixed on 2800 ETH) all funds will be returned automatically to the\\nMTH holders by the Ethereum smart contract.\\n\\ne Token Creation has a hard cap: upon achieving this cap, token creation will\\nstop and no further contributions will be accepted. The hard cap amount is 95\\n000 ETH.\\n\\ne Tokens that are not sold during the Crowdsale will be burned automatically by\\nthe smart contract\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIssuer Monetha GmbH\\n\\nJurisdiction of Issuance Switzerland\\n\\nLegal qualification Utility Coin, not a security\\n\\nMTH created per ether 2000 MTH\\n\\nMinimal goal EUR 700k (fixed on 2800\\nETH)\\n\\nSoft Cap EUR 7m (fixed on 28000\\nETH)\\n\\n \\n\\n35\\n\\x0c \\n\\nHard Cap\\n\\n95 000 ETH\\n\\n \\n\\nAdditional\\n\\n120h if soft cap is reached\\n\\n \\n\\nMaximum number of tokens generated\\n\\n402 400 000\\n\\n \\n\\n% of tokens generated to Monetha\\nteam\\n\\n15%.

The token is a digital\\nasset, bearing value by itself based on its underlying assets, properties and/or\\n\\nassociated rights.\\n\\nM\\n\\n36\\n\\x0cEthereum-based tokens rely on a well-established Ethereum infrastructure,\\nbenefiting from several advantages:\\n\\ne Security and predictability (as opposed to, for example, having to run an\\nindependent blockchain network).\\n\\ne Use of robust and well-supported clients (Ethereum-based tokens can be\\nmanaged with official Ethereum clients).\\n\\ne High liquidity (interchangeable with other Ethereum-based tokens or Ether),\\neasier listing on exchanges with infrastructure already in place.\\n\\nOur Ethereum-based token contract complies with the ERC20 standard. More\\ndetailed info about the ERC20 standard can be obtained from:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/E!Ps/issues/20\\n\\n6.3 Incentive program\\n\\nAlways with the scope to create a network effect, Monetha has decided to increase\\nthe purchase value of the MTH on the Monetha platform, by shifting % of Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrevenue in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVoucher Smart contract\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with an ability to claim for a voucher\\nproportionately to the amount of MTH tokens that they hold. Token holders will\\nreceive a voucher in MTH (Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s currency) to use it as a discount when\\nshopping with Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s merchants. This voucher would be proportional to the\\namount of the MTH tokens held.\\n\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how it works:\\n\\n*Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say we have 1000 investors as MTH holders, holding 1 MTH each. Now, all\\ntoken holders equally hold 0.1% of the total token supply.\\n\\n*Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s merchants sold 100 000 ETH worth of goods and services in\\none month and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say that 1ETH = 1MTH. Because Monetha takes 1.5%\\ntransaction fee from merchants, Monetha will have 1500 ETH of revenue collected.\\n\\n*For this scenario, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c4 of Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revenue means % of 1500 ETH = 500 ETH.\\nTherefore, we will put 500 MTH in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVoucher Smart Contract\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\n\\nWe get 500 MTH Voucher that is available to use for MTH holders in Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\necosystem. All 1000 MTH holders will equally have the ability to use 500 MTH\\n\\nM\\n\\n37\\n\\x0cVoucher when shopping with Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s merchants. In this case, one token holder\\nwill be able to spend up to 0.1% of 500 MTH (=0.5 MTH each).\\n\\nThis voucher will be redeemable if you transfer your MTH tokens to the smart\\ncontract address on the 1st day of every month. Then, within the 24 hour window,\\nyour MTH tokens will be returned to your wallet. You will be able to accumulate your\\nvoucher each month and spend the amount you collected over the 6 month period in\\nthe Monetha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ecosystem. Each month\\'s collected MTH voucher will be viable to\\nspend for the upcoming 6 months. Unclaimed/unused revenue from vouchers will be\\nput in a pool for the next month.\\n\\nThe MTH voucher is not compare to the MTH token. The voucher is not transferable,\\ncannot be sold and can only be used for purchasing discounted goods on the\\nMonetha Platform.\\n\\nThe duration of this incentive program will stay at full discretion of Monetha, but will\\nat least last for the first 24 months starting from the first purchasing activity on the\\nplatform.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n6.4 Budget\\n\\nField Portion of budget Activities\\n\\nLegal 10% Company establishment,\\ncontracts with merchants,\\netc.\\n\\nProduct Development 50% Product development\\naccording to development\\nroadmap\\n\\nOperations 10% Management, employee\\nsalaries.\\n\\nMarketing, sales, 30% Expenses for attracting\\n\\nmerchant acquisition & merchants, making\\n\\npartnerships partnerships with\\npayment providers, loyalty\\nprogram\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n38\\n\\x0c7.

usd 4 058 trillion by 2020  e commerce share of retail sales is expected\\nto increase from 7 4  in 2015 to 14 6  in 2020  furthermore  according to statista \\nthe number of people buying goods or services online will increase from 1 46 billion\\nin 2015 to above 2 billion in 2020 \\n\\ndespite the explosive growth  three major problems still exist \\n\\n1  trust and reputation  building trust is difficult  and it is centrally governed by\\nbig marketplaces  there is an inability to transfer trust from one centralized\\nservice to another  and thus a need to establish relationship with each\\nmerchant separately  moreover  a merchant s history is not recorded  so there\\nis no ability to punish fraudulent buyers or merchants  huge efforts and\\nadvertising budgets are needed to create trust if a merchant is not a part of a\\ncentralized marketplace \\n\\n2  expensive and long payment process  there are 16    different steps to\\nsettle the transaction and up to 15    different fees to pay for payment\\ngateways  transaction fees range from 2    0 1 to 6    0 7  chargeback\\nfees of usd 15  moreover  existing payment gateways rarely offer a simple\\nsolution for a merchant to accept mobile payments on their website or point of\\nsale terminals \\n\\n3  an inability to reach the growing ethereum economy  today  merchants\\ncannot accept payments in ether  which has reached a market cap of usd\\n36bn as of june 14th  moreover  a totally new digital asset class is being\\ncreated  tokens of products that are built on the ethereum platform  the rise\\nof a new kind of digital assets enables the creation of a token based digital\\nasset economy  it is expected that 10  of global gdp will be generated on\\nblockchains by 2025  merchants will definitely want to participate in the\\nblockchain created economy \\n\\nmonetha is creating a universal decentralized trust and reputation solution\\nworking flawlessly together with mobile payments processing on the\\nethereum blockchain leveraging smart contract technology \\n\\n1  universal transferable trust and reputation system  every time a\\n\\ntransaction is made the blockchain will record the time of the transaction  both\\nreceiving and sending wallet addresses  warranty conditions  delivery time \\n\\nm\\n\\x0cand all other information that is typically needed to ensure trust  all the\\nsensitive information will be hashed and only available to authorized users in\\na beautifully designed user interface  based on that information  clients and\\nmerchants will be able to file solve a claim  rate each other  etc  every time a\\ntransaction is made  claim registered  solved or unsolved  according to\\nthe purchase details saved during the purchase   review written  etc   the\\nsmart contract will automatically change the trust level for each of the\\nparties involved \\n\\n2  mobile payments solution  with the help of the ethereum blockchain  we\\nare able to make payments with only 1 step and 1 fee  which results in\\naccepting payments generally up to 5x cheaper and up to x10000 faster for\\nmerchants  after simple integration with monetha  merchants will be able to \\nuse our decentralized trust and reputation system  accept ethereum based\\ntokens  accept mobile payments  and easily convert cryptocurrency to their\\nlocal fiat currency \\n\\n3  enabling merchants to reach  10 trillion digital asset economy  by\\ndeveloping monetha  we will not only allow merchants to participate ina\\ntrustful decentralized economy  but also reach the growing digital asset\\neconomy through our payment solution  the world bank estimates that 10 \\nof global gdp will be generated on blockchains by 2025  the gdp estimated\\nfor 2025 is  100t  thus the value generated through blockchain is expected to\\nbe  10t  10   \\n\\nmobile payments  according to boston consulting group  the payment industry is\\nabout to experience a huge shift towards mobile payments  1  in 2015 mobile\\npayment volume was usd 8 6 billion in the us  it is expected to increase almost 32x\\nby 2021 to reach  274bn in the us alone  2  mobile share of total ecommerce is\\nexpected to increase to 48 5  of total e commerce by 2020  it was 23 6  in 2015 \\n\\nbusiness model  monetha will only have one fee   a 1 5  transaction fee for\\nmerchants \\n\\ntoken and token ecosystem  a   of monetha s revenue will be put in the  voucher\\nsmart contract  in a form of mth tokens to our token holders with an ability to claim for a\\nvoucher proportionately to the amount of mth tokens they hold  token holders will receive a\\nvoucher in mth  monetha s currency  to use it as a discount when buying from monetha s\\nmerchants  this voucher would be proportional to the amount of the mth tokens held \\n\\nloyalty program  in order to encourage a network effect and create an ecosystem\\nfor the monetha token  we are going to introduce a loyalty program for merchants \\n\\nm\\n\\x0cevery purchase made via the monetha payment system will reward the client of the\\nmerchant with 0 2   the exact percentage might change over time  of the value of\\nthe transaction in monetha tokens from the monetha loyalty pool \\n\\n1  three significant problems that merchants\\nface  trust and reputation  payments  and an\\ninability to reach the growing ethereum\\neconomy\\n\\ne commerce has grown at an unprecedented rate and is projected to grow at an\\neven higher rate over the coming years  according to  statista   retail e commerce\\n\\nsales worldwide in 2014 were usd 1 33 trillion and are projected to increase to usd\\n4 058 trillion by 2020 \\n\\n5 000\\n\\n4 058\\n\\nq 4 000\\ng 3 418\\n3 3 000 2 860\\ns\\n8 2 352\\n3 2 000 1915\\n  1 336 1 548\\n5\\na a\\n\\n  2014 2015 2016 2017  2018  2019  2020 \\n\\nthe growth is perfectly illustrated by the number of shops created on the shopify\\nplatform  they had 84 000 shops in 2013  144 000 in 2014  243 000 in 2015 and\\nended 2016 with almost 378 000 merchants on the platform   a growth of 450  over\\n3 years \\n\\nm\\n\\x0ce commerce is also gaining greater weight in total retail sales globally  it is expected\\nto increase from 7 4  in 2015 to 14 6  in 2020  furthermore  according to statista \\nthe number of people buying goods or services online will increase from 1 46 billion\\n\\nin 2015 to above 2 billion in 2020 \\n\\ndespite the super high growth of e commerce  merchants face three major\\n\\nproblems  1  trust and reputation  2  expensive and long payment process  and\\n3  an inability to reach the growing ethereum ecosystem  with a market cap of\\n 36 billion and its corresponding ethereum token economy \\n\\n1 1 trust and reputation problem in global e commerce\\n\\nbuilding trust is difficult  it takes time and costs a lot of money  it s even more difficult\\nfor new or small merchants \\n\\ntrust and reputation are extremely important for participants of today s global\\ncommerce  people are more likely to buy from trusted merchants  therefore \\nmerchants are striving to maximise their trust rating reputation and build a loyal\\ncustomer base \\n\\naccording to econsultancy  61  of customers read online reviews before making a\\npurchase decision  moreover  according to reevo stats  63  of customers are more\\nlikely to make a purchase from a site which has user reviews and a proven trust\\nrating \\n\\nconsumer reviews are significantly more trusted  nearly 12 times more  than\\ndescriptions that come from manufacturers  according to a survey of us internet\\nusers by the online video review site expo  furthermore  shopify  in one of their\\nmerchant blogs  emphasized that  showing that others trust you  is vital toa\\nmerchant s success \\n\\nthere are  however  a few major problems regarding trust that merchants face in\\ntoday s global e commerce \\n\\n1  the trust and reputation system to facilitate commerce is only possible in closed\\nmarketplaces  which are controlled by a central authority  in order to build trust  you\\nhave to join one or a few of the closed marketplaces  such as  amazon  ebay \\nalibaba  etc  by joining them  merchant must accept all their rules  for example  20 \\ncommission from sales \\n\\nm\\n\\x0c2  merchants have no ability to transfer their trust rate from one centralized\\nservice to another  for example  once you become trusted on amazon  you still must\\nbuild your trust on ebay or another marketplace \\n\\n3  merchants have to invest considerable effort and finance into their brand and\\nadvertising if they do not want to join the centralized marketplace that facilitates\\ntrust and reputation \\n\\n4  buyers need to establish a relationship with each merchant separately \\nmoreover  a buyer s history is not available for merchants to make decisions  being\\ntrusted with one merchant doesn t mean you are trusted with another \\n\\n5  there is no ability to punish fraudulent buyers or merchants and reflect that in their\\nhistory  most fraud happens due to stolen cards or stolen credit card information  in\\n2015  card fraud reached  21 84 billion   a figure that is expected to rise to  31 67\\nbillion by 2020  according to advanced payment report 2016 conducted with the\\nhelp of wirecard de  92  of merchants say fraud will remain a prime concern for\\nonline payments  large e commerce and m commerce merchants lose 1 4  and\\n1 7  of revenues respectively to fraud according to the 2015 true cost of fraud\\nstudy \\n\\nthere are millions of e commerce merchants outside closed marketplaces that need\\na universal trust and reputation system in order to be trusted by their clients \\n\\nin order to build global trust in e commerce  we need a universal trust and\\nreputation system  payments and commerce using monetha will be done directly\\nbetween two unknown parties using a much needed decentralized  smart contract\\nbased  trust and reputation system \\n\\n1 2 expensive and long payment process\\n\\ndespite having a wide variety of different payment gateways and processing\\ncompanies  the following major problems still exist for merchants \\n\\ne costly and complex transaction settlements with up to 16    steps to accept\\nand settle transactions \\n\\ne up to 15    different type of fees including a transaction fee of between 2 \\nto 6   and a chargeback fee of usd 20 \\n\\ne extremely high cross border transaction fees \\n\\ne long transaction times ranging from 2 days to several weeks to receive their\\nmoney  e commerce payment processors often hold merchants  money for a\\nweek due to higher probability of chargebacks during first week after\\n\\nm\\n\\x0c1 2 1\\n\\npurchase \\n\\nmobile payments  mobile payment solutions are fragmented and not available\\nuniversally or simply not easy to use despite a strong consumer appetite to\\nleverage them  payment processors rarely offer a simple solution for a\\nmerchant to accept mobile payments \\n\\ncurrent payment process\\n\\nthe picture below describes the payment confirmation or rejection in 8 steps at the\\ntime of payment regardless of it being in a physical store  e commerce or\\nm commerce  the process is complex and includes 8 additional steps to settle the\\ntransaction  in total  you have 16 steps for money to be transferred from the client s\\nbank account to the merchant s bank account \\n\\n1 2 2\\n\\n  \\n\\nvisa\\n \\n\\nor pr oh\\n\\n

and 6  per transaction\\nplus a fixed fee which is between usd 0 1 and usd 0 7  for example  every\\ntime someone makes a transaction for usd 10  the merchant on average\\npays    10   0 02 0 06  2      0 1 0 7  2     usd 0 8 for banks  credit card\\nassociations  payment gateways and processors \\n\\nretrieval request fee and chargeback fee are paid when someone claims\\nfor a chargeback  the best known payment gateways such as paypal and\\nstripe charge merchants a usd 15 chargeback fee  in addition to the\\nchargeback fee  there is work to be done by the retailer to prove the\\n\\nm\\n\\x0ctransaction was done respecting the rules  this costs time and money  when\\nthe info is missing  the charge is reversed even if it was legit \\n\\ne flat fees include  terminal fees to buy the needed terminal for retail\\nmerchants  pci fees paid to payment card industry for compliance or\\nnoncompliance  and others  such as  annual fees  monthly fees  monthly\\nminimum fees  irs reporting fees  network fees  etc \\n\\ne incidental fees that consist of  address verification service  avs   voice\\nauthorization fee  vaf   batch fee  and nfs fee \\n\\ne cross border fees  paypal  for example  charges the merchant a transaction\\nfee of 4 4    fixed fee  depends on the currency   instead of 2 9    fixed fee\\n depends on the currency  if the funds the merchant is receiving comes from\\noutside of the u s \\n\\nfinally  some payment gateways and or processing companies like to keep their fee\\nstructure hidden or totally incomprehensible to the average merchant \\n\\n1 2 3 long fund transfer time\\n\\nas there are a lot of different parties involved in moving the money from one bank\\naccount to another  or from one country to another   it often takes up 3 days to\\nsettle the transaction  for international payments  it can take up to a week or\\neven more  moreover  payment gateways more often than not hold your money for a\\nweek \\n\\nthat often causes cash flow problems for small merchants \\n\\n1 2 4 mobile payments\\n\\naccording to statcounter  october 2016 was the first ever month in the history when\\nmore users around the world accessed the internet from mobile devices than from\\ndesktop computers  of all users  51 3  used mobile devices while 48 7  used\\ncomputers  moreover  according to statista  approximately 80  of internet usage\\nwill be mobile by 2018  at the same time  mobile payments are projected to\\nincrease from usd 8 6bn in 2015 to usd 274bn in 2021 \\n\\nthe problem is that most e commerce and retail payment gateways and or terminals\\n\\nwere developed to accept and process payments using physical credit cards  and at\\ntheir core  cards are not mobile friendly  payment gateways rarely offer a simple\\n\\nm\\n\\x0csolution for a merchant to accept mobile payments in their website or point of sale\\nterminals \\n\\n1 3 an inability to participate in token enabled digital asset\\neconomy potentially worth  10t in 2025 \\n\\nthe market cap of all the ethereum tokens is growing extraordinarily fast  ether\\nreached a market cap of usd 36bn as of june 14th  but most importantly  a totally\\nnew market of digital assets is being created  tokens of projects that are built on\\nethereum platform  the rise of new kind of digital assets enables the creation of a\\ntoken based digital asset economy \\n\\na correspondent of bloomberg talks about it here  starting from 2 00 \\n\\nthe world bank estimates that 10  of global gdp will be generated on blockchains\\nby 2025  the gdp estimated for 2025 is  100t  thus the value generated through\\nblockchain is expected to be  10t  10   \\n\\ntoday  merchants don t have an opportunity to access that money  they will have a\\nconsiderable incentive to participate in the token economy within the next few years \\n\\n2  monetha s solution  a decentralized trust and\\nreputation system working flawlessly together\\nthrough a blockchain based payment gateway\\n\\nwe are creating a decentralized payment and trust solution on the ethereum\\nblockchain leveraging smart contract technology  the payment solution works\\nflawlessly together with our decentralized trust and reputation system  merchants will\\nbe able to accept ethereum based cryptocurrencies and exchange them with\\ntraditional  fiat  currencies  merchants and customers will participate in global\\ndecentralized commerce with total trust \\n\\nmonetha is on a mission to \\n\\ne develop a global decentralized trust and reputation system for tomorrow s\\nglobal e commerce \\n\\nm\\n\\x0ce make the payment process simple and efficient  only one step \\n\\ne make accepting payments for merchants generally up to 5x cheaper and up\\nto 10 000 times faster \\n\\ne provide an opportunity for merchants to accept mobile payments \\n\\ne bring the ethereum based token economy to the mainstream \\n\\ne expand ethereum real world application infrastructure \\n\\nin simple words  our mission is to develop and deploy the best transaction system that\\nwould be based on enforceable contracts without third party between consumer and\\nmerchants and a strong decentralised reputation management system  transaction\\nand fund transfer will be done in one step together with the enforceable sale\\ncontract  transaction fees would be simplified from many to a simple transaction fee\\nwherever the consumer and merchants are located on the planet \\n\\n2 1 a universal decentralized trust and reputation system on\\nthe ethereum blockchain  ensuring trust in global commerce \\n\\nbuilding trust is difficult because \\n\\ne merchants need to become part of a centrally governed marketplace  like\\namazon  ebay  alibaba  etsy  etc  where they must pay a sales commission \\n\\ne merchants cannot transfer their trust from one centralized service to another \\n\\ne merchants need to invest huge efforts and budgets into brand and advertising\\nif not being part of centralized marketplace \\n\\ne complicated conflict management using existing system \\n\\ne buyers need to establish a relationship with each merchant separately and\\ntheir history is not transparent \\n\\ne there is no ability to punish fraudulent buyers or merchants and reflect that in\\ntheir history \\n\\nmonetha s trust and reputation system will be universal  transparent \\ntransferable  self executing  not controlled by a central authority  and working\\nflawlessly together with a payment solution \\n\\n2 1 1 how it works\\n\\nevery time a transaction is made  no matter if it s retail or e commerce  the\\nblockchain will save the time of the transaction  both the receiving and sending\\naddresses  warranty conditions  delivery time  and all other information that is\\ntypically needed to ensure the trust  all the sensitive information will be hashed and\\nonly available to authorized users in a beautifully designed user interface  based on\\n\\nm\\n\\n10\\n\\x0cthat information  clients and merchants will be able to file solve a claim  rate each\\nother  etc \\n\\ndefault trust rates will be created for both merchant and client using the monetha\\necosystem for the first time  a trust rating will be assigned to a specific wallet\\naddress  every time a transaction is made  claim registered  solved or unsolved\\n according to the purchase details saved during the purchase   review written \\netc   the smart contract will automatically change the trust level for each of the\\nparties involved \\n\\nthe merchant trust rating\\n\\nonce the merchant starts accepting mobile ethereum based currency payments\\nusing monetha  a default trust rating will be created  smart contract will automatically\\nchange the trust rating according to the behavior of the merchant  for example \\n\\ne does the merchant react to claims from clients \\n\\ne does the merchant react quickly to claims from clients \\n\\ne doclients rate the merchant for delivering products as promised  on time  as\\nadvertised and in good quality \\n\\ne does the merchant have good reviews from clients \\n\\ndifferent weights will be assigned to different actions \\n\\nthe trust rating will be visible to everyone in the most common and typical places \\nsuch as the footer of the merchant s website or mobile app  the only way the\\nmerchant can increase the trust rating is by providing products or services as\\nadvertised and in good condition \\n\\ntrust client s trust rating\\n\\nthe main reason to create a trust rating for the client is to decrease the likelihood of\\nfraudulent buyers and offer loyalty features for trustful buyers \\n\\nonce a client buys something from a merchant using monetha for the first time  the\\ndefault trust rating for that client will be automatically created and linked to the wallet\\naddress of that client \\n\\nthe client trust rating will be updated automatically by the smart contract based on\\nhis or her behavior  different weights will be assigned to different actions  for\\nexample \\n\\nm\\n\\n11\\n\\x0cwhat is the client s claim history \\n\\nhow many claims has the user made  are those claims being resolved \\nhave all the previous claims been solved with merchants \\n\\npurchase history  behavior  frequency  etc \\n\\nthe trust rate of the client will be available to see on the blockchain and visible in a\\nuser friendly interface to merchants once the purchase is made \\n\\nthe client s trust rating will be visible on the blockchain or in monetha s mobile app \\n\\nin totally decentralized e commerce  it is important that merchants have information\\nabout the client  the most important thing for a merchant is to avoid someone who\\ndoes hazardous things on purpose  if that happens  the merchant will be able to\\ndecrease the client s trust rating significantly  based on that information  other\\nmerchants will be able to decide whether they want to sell products to a client with a\\nlow trust rating \\n\\nclaims  reviews and conflict management \\n\\nevery purchase will be saved on the blockchain together with the time of the\\ntransaction  both receiving and sending addresses  warranty conditions  estimated\\ndelivery date  the product that was bought and all other information that is typically\\nneeded to ensure trust \\n\\nthe following information will be available to both parties \\n\\ne the merchant will have all the information about every transaction with the\\nabove mentioned details in his profile in the monetha system \\n\\ne the client will be able to see all his purchases together with the\\nabove mentioned details only in his profile within the monetha mobile app \\n\\nbased on that information  parties will have an opportunity to file resolve claims \\nreview  and rate each other in a transparent way  smart contract will automatically\\ndecrease or increase the trust rating  that kind of management of conflict resolution\\nthrough smart contracts will help each party to deal with the situation faster  easier\\nand cheaper  no chargeback fees for the merchant  \\n\\nexamples \\n1  claim  once the client makes a purchase  all the needed information is saved\\n\\nto the blockchain  in order to see that information  the client must download\\nthe monetha app  once he logs in  he sees all the purchases he made with a\\n\\nm\\n\\n12\\n\\x0cparticular wallet address anywhere using monetha as a payment gateway \\nthe client selects the particular purchase he is not happy about  and initiates\\na claim by providing the details of the claim  e g   the product is broken  the\\nmerchant s trust rating is immediately decreased  so the merchant is\\nincentivized to solve the problem as quickly as possible  the merchant\\nreceives the notification about the claim  looks at the details and contacts the\\nclient off chain  client and merchant agree on the solution and one of the\\nparties initiates a resolution by pressing the  claim resolved  button in the\\nmobile app or the merchant system  details of how the situation was resolved\\n product changed  money returned  etc   must be provided as well  the details\\nare saved to the blockchain  the other party gets the notification  reads the\\ndetails and agrees by pressing  claim resolved   once the claim is resolved \\ntrust rating is increased for both parties instantly \\n\\n  reviews  clients and merchants will be able to write reviews about each\\nother  written reviews will have more weight on each other s trust rating than\\njust  silent  transactions without a review  for example  a client s review about\\na good product and customer service will increase the merchant s trust rating\\nmore than just a simple  silent  transaction without writing a review  reviews\\nabout the merchant will be visible in the mobile app for a client  merchants will\\nsee the reviews clients have written about them in their system  all reviews \\ngood and bad  will be automatically reflected in the trust rating of the\\nclient and the merchant \\n\\n  sales contracts  a merchant can propose a 15 day return policy   no\\nquestions asked  this merchant will be in a better position to sell than the one\\nwho does not offer a return policy  these rules will be published by the\\nmerchant  smart contract will ensure merchants and consumers are\\nrespecting their commitments to each other and the rating system will reflect\\nthat \\n\\n2 1 2 how the likelihood of fraud is reduced with a global decentralized\\nreputation and trust system\\n\\nthe trust rate will be available and visible to everyone in the ecosystem so that\\nparties are incentivized to increase their trust rating  which will enable better\\ndecision making and a safer e commerce environment  moreover  we will offer\\nincentives such as a reduced transaction fee  faster transaction times  etc   for those\\nwho hold higher ratings and proven history  this level of transparency could\\ndecrease fraud significantly or at least make it more difficult \\n\\nm\\n\\n13\\n\\x0cto illustrate this point  kevin kelly  the author of a book titled  out of control   wrote \\n\\na pretty good society needs more than just anonymity  an online\\ncivilization requires online anonymity  online identification  online\\nauthentication  online reputations  online trust holders  online\\nsignatures  online privacy  and online access  all are essential\\ningredients of any open society \\n\\nwe bring this to the next level  we want to create a transferable trust system so that\\nevery merchant  big and small  retail or e commerce  will be able to join a\\nglobal decentralized trust rating system by accepting mobile payments with\\nmonetha \\n\\n2 2 a mobile payments solution to accept mobile ethereum\\nbased cryptocurrency payments generally up to 5x cheaper\\nand up to x10000 faster \\n\\nafter simple integration with monetha  merchants will be able to \\n\\ne use our decentralized trust and reputation system \\ne accept ethereum based tokens \\ne easily convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency \\n\\n2 2 1 how it works  e commerce example\\n\\nclients will pick their items  add them to the cart and select that they will pay through\\nthe monetha gateway instead of other available options such as credit card or\\npaypal \\n\\nthe amount needed to pay is converted to the selected ethereum based currency\\n token  from traditional currency in real time  a qr code is generated which the\\nclient scans with any crypto wallet on his mobile app and presses  send   money\\narrives in merchant s smart contract wallet in approximately 2 minutes  the amount\\nof ethereum based currency received is exchanged to a merchant s preferred fiat\\ncurrency according to the merchant s preference via kraken or another crypto\\nexchange api  merchants will be able to choose the frequency at which crypto\\ntokens are converted to fiat  the local currency to exchange to  time of sending\\nmoney to their bank account  and many other options \\n\\nm\\n\\n14\\n\\x0cmonetha is easy  fast  cheap  and guaranteed by smart contracts \\nhow merchant payment fees and transaction time are resolved\\n\\nthe picture below shows how blockchain changes the method of payment  the\\ntransaction goes from customer to merchant directly  ditching all the intermediaries in\\nthe process and saving merchants a huge amount of time and money  there is no\\nneed to close or settle anything for merchant anymore  the settlement and closing\\nhappens at the same time as the transaction  there is only 1 step instead of 16 \\n\\nas the payment now goes directly from the client to merchant  instead of waiting for\\nup to 2 weeks to see the funds  it arrives approximately 2 minutes after the\\npurchase no matter where in the world the purchase was made \\n\\nas far as payment fees are concerned  instead of 15 types of fees merchants may\\npay using a standard payment gateway  with monetha  they will have only 1 fee  a\\ntransaction fee of 1 5  \\n\\nthe chargeback fee goes away as well  once the merchant agrees to send the\\nmoney back  they just send the money back and pay the transaction fee  no\\nridiculously high chargeback fees anymore  in addition  the pain  time and money to\\nprove the transaction is legit  is gone  moreover  the decentralized trust and\\nreputation system helps to decrease the rate of fraudulent payments as well \\n\\nultimately  it s up to x5 cheaper and up to x10000 faster for merchants to accept\\npayments with monetha  with a transparent fee structure with no chargeback or\\nhidden fees  and a beautiful user interface with smart contract enabled wallet\\nsecurity \\n\\n15\\n\\x0c  \\n   \\n\\ne  clients bank\\n\\nmerchants bank\\n  x \\ncredit card network\\ni \\n\\n \\ncredit card network\\nv\\n\\n     \\n     \\n\\nv\\nen\\nee\\n\\nnonead of settlement and closing of account\\n\\nsmart contract based wallet for merchants\\n\\nthe merchant s account acts as the equivalent of a bank account that stores funds\\nand enforces security  the crucial fact here is that it s only controlled by the user  the\\nmerchant  today  banks hold higher authority because they run the database that\\npoints at the database entry which says you have that money and you have to trust\\nthat your money is safe  banks own the control of that database and authority to\\ngrant or deny the access to the money they hold  not anymore \\n\\nmonetha will not be able to suspend  hold or prevent any transaction  instead \\npermissionless transactions will be guaranteed by the smart contract  instantly  and\\nas promised  no more headache of not knowing where the merchant s money is and\\nwhy it s being withheld \\n\\nmerchants can customize their settings to fit their preferences  such as \\n\\ne how much funds to exchange with the local currency \\ne how often to exchange \\ne others \\n\\nwith monetha  we are giving control of merchant funds back into their own hands\\nand giving them easy to manage control of their funds received from selling goods or\\nservices which is safeguarded by the security of smart contracts  now  merchants\\n\\nm\\n\\n16\\n\\x0ccan have better security and substantially improved usability \\nit is literally a merchant becoming his own bank \\n\\n2 2 2 case studies  merchant fees and transaction time\\nmerchant fees\\n\\njohn is the owner of a small e commerce store selling t shirts for usd 10  he was\\nalways frustrated by the transactions fees he paid to the banks and other\\nintermediaries \\n\\none day  he found out about monetha through a financial news article and decided\\nto try it out  it took him only a few minutes to get started  now the transaction money\\ngoes directly from the client to his account  that means that from now on  john will\\nnot only be able to accept mobile payments  but also  more importantly  instead of\\npaying every intermediary in the payment process from 2  0 1 up to 6  0 7 per\\ntransaction  john now pays only 1 5  per transaction  so instead of paying eur 0 8\\non average every time someone buys a t shirt  john will now only pay eur 0 15\\nper transaction using monetha as his mobile payments processor  that s 5x times\\ncheaper on average \\n\\nmoreover  monetha exchanges ethereum based currencies with his local currency\\nand sends the money to his bank according to predefined settings  upon his request\\nor automatically \\n\\ntransaction time and cash flow problems  e commerce merchant \\n\\npeter has a website where he sells various home appliances to customers all around\\nthe globe for almost 12 years now  he knows money is just a digit that must be\\nexchanged once the transaction is made  that s why he cannot believe how long it\\ntakes for him to receive the funds after a client places an order \\n\\nif the client is local  the funds show up in his bank account in up to 2 3 days  but if\\nthe client is from the other side of the world  it may take up to 2 weeks for funds to\\nshow up his bank account  he has to trust the client and the banks and ship the\\nproduct before he receives the funds  moreover  the payment gateway often holds\\nthe money for a week  because of the time it takes for him to receive the money  he\\noften experiences cash flow problems and  consequently  is not able to pay\\nhis suppliers \\n\\none day  a friend of peter told him about monetha  the friend told him that it takes\\n\\nm\\n\\n17\\n\\x0cup to 2 minutes to receive money with monetha after a purchase was made  with\\nmonetha  peter can accept mobile payments and receive funds instantly no\\nmatter where the client is after the purchase is made  he no longer has to trust\\nbanks  payment gateways or pdf files generated as a proof of payment that clients\\nsend him  furthermore  monetha solved his cash flow problems instantly  he\\nreceives funds  can ship products instantly and order more shoes without a fear of\\nnot being able to pay \\n\\n2 3 enabling merchants to reach  10 trillion digital asset\\neconomy\\n\\nby developing monetha  we will not only allow merchants to participate in a trustful\\ndecentralized economy  but also reach the growing digital asset economy through\\nour payment solution \\n\\n2 3 1 growth of ether as a currency and the ethereum ecosystem s\\ndigital token economy\\n\\nas shown above  a correspondent for bloomberg

new and exclusively digital asset class \\ntokens  as discussed above  the world bank estimates that 10  of global gdp \\nwhich is approximately  10t  will go through blockchains in 2025 \\n\\nto illustrate the fact  let us look at the graph below showing the growth of altcoins \\n\\nthis growth is influenced by the ascendency of ether as a currency and the\\nexpansion of ethereum based tokens

number one cryptocurrency platform soon\\nbecause it facilitates the creation of an ecosystem that bitcoin cannot match \\n\\nat the same time  it gets harder and harder to make transactions on bitcoin \\naccording to www blockchain info  the  average confirmation time  to confirm a\\ntransaction was 316 minutes as of june 13 and  cost per transaction  was\\n\\napproximately usd 4 \\n\\nmerchants cannot use services such as bitpay to accept bitcoin payments when\\n\\nm\\n\\n19\\n\\x0ctransaction time is that long and the cost per transaction is that high \\n\\nthis fact causes bitcoin s weight relative to other currencies to decrease dramatically\\nand the graph below demonstrates that pretty well  just a few months ago  bitcoin\\naccounted for more than 80  of all the market cap of cryptocurrencies  as of june\\n14th  it s approximately 39   while ethereum is already 31 7   ethereum is one of\\nthe reasons why the relative weight of bitcoin is decreasing \\n\\n100

will go to\\na  voucher smart contract  in a for of mth for monetha token holders for an ability\\nto use that in the monetha s ecosystem and other 1  will go to the company as\\nrevenues \\n\\nan interesting fact is that the average traditional payment gateways take\\napproximately only 0 25    0 1 from total fee as their revenue  this 0 25    0 1 is a\\nmark up fee to the interchange rates \\n\\nfor example  if the total transaction fee that merchant is charged is 2 35     0 2 \\nthe 2 1    0 2 is the interchange part that banks  credit card associations and\\nothers are dividing and 0 25     0 1 is the markup part  which payment gateways\\ntake home as revenue  we not only decrease the transaction fee that merchant has\\nto pay  let alone the other fees that he will not have to worry about anymore  but we\\nare also left with approximately four times the rate to do business with \\n\\nm\\n\\n31\\n\\x0c5  marketing and strategy\\n5 1 network effect\\n\\nour strategy is focused on creating a network effect as our decentralized trust and\\nreputation system enables us to do that  moreover  we will use the well known\\nbowling pin strategy  start with a niche market  stage 2  existing crypto community  \\nand then move to other niches and broader markets \\n\\nstage 1  in our case  we are focusing on the supply side first  being accepted in as\\nmany locations as fast as possible through partnerships that enables instant scale \\nto achieve that  we will partner with payment providers that can give us instant\\nscale  we are already in positive talks with major players  revel systems and\\nshopify  being the biggest  as of the end of 2016  shopify had over 377k merchants\\non its platform  \\n\\nstage 2  educate the initial client base in the existing crypto community  main value\\npropositions  decentralized trust system  no need to pay credit card network fees  no\\nspending limit \\n\\nstage 3  broader market adoption \\n\\n1  once again  supply side first  monetha is accepted in even more\\nlocations globally \\n\\n2  education of general public  supply increases exposure and people are\\nwilling to buy more from trusted merchants  only merchants accepting\\npayments through monetha will be guaranteed to be trustful by\\ndecentralized reputation and trust system \\n\\n3  once there are more people willing to pay with their mobile phones at\\ntrusted merchants  more merchants will join the network \\n\\nnetwork effect is very well illustrated by metcalfe s law  for example  one\\ntelephone is useless  two people with telephones can only make one connection \\nwhile five telephones make 10 connections and twelve telephones make 66\\nconnections \\n\\nv alue of a network   n n 1  2  where n is number of people using the network\\n\\nfocusing on the supply side first drives the demand which in turn drives the supply \\nnetwork effect kicks in  the more users there are  the more valuable it is  this\\nrapid adoption is then self perpetuating as both sides value the access to a bigger\\nnetwork of users  read  more choice    higher probability of finding a match   coupled\\n\\nm\\n\\n32\\n\\x0cwith the improved transaction experience \\n\\nthe importance of network effect was very well described by the vice president of\\nbessemer venture partners  investors are linkedin  shopify  etc   in this linkedin\\npost \\nhttps   www linkedin com pulse winning marketplace importance supply side raghav \\nbahl\\n\\nthe growth of the ecosystem following those steps is illustrated in the graph below \\nthat is how  in most cases  marketplaces and ecosystems are being built \\n\\ny    \\n\\ny wo\\n\\n5 2 loyalty program\\n\\nin order to encourage networks effects and create an ecosystem for monetha token \\nwe are going to introduce a loyalty program for clients  that is unprecedented as\\nmost loyalty programs are facilitated by merchants themselves and not payment\\nproviders \\n\\n5 1 1 how does the loyalty program work \\n\\ne every purchase made via the monetha payment system will reward the client\\nwith 0 2   the percentage might change over time  of the value of the\\ntransaction in monetha tokens from the monetha loyalty pool  this is provided\\n\\nm\\n\\n33\\n\\x0cby monetha no matter what goods or services the client buys or where the\\nmerchant and client are based \\n\\ne loyalty tokens can be used during any purchase using a monetha wallet \\no the client picks an item he she wants to buy\\n0 if the client has monetha tokens she he can apply them to reduce the\\nitems cost  the client gets a discount \\no monetha tokens are converted to eth in real time \\no monetha tokens are returned to monetha loyalty pool \\no monetha platform covers a discount for the merchant  so he gets the\\nfull item price \\no monetha tokens can be applied for up to 70  of the purchase value \\no the client is still getting 0 2  of the amount paid by eth  or other\\ncryptocurrency  after loyalty is applied \\ne tokens acquired in this way are eligible for a discount for 6 months  unused\\ntokens are returned back to monetha loyalty token pool \\ne the client cannot convert tokens exchanged in this way to any crypto or fiat\\ncurrency \\ne the merchant is able to provide bigger loyalty discounts for his clients by\\nadjusting his loyalty settings in merchants interface \\ne clients with high trust are eligible for higher discount percentage than 0 2  \\ne the exact percentage of loyalty mth tokens granted with every purchase\\nmight change over time \\n\\n34\\n\\x0c6  crowdsale details\\n\\nthe monetha crowdsale and the corresponding token creation process will be issued\\nby monetha gmbh  a swiss limited liability company  and will be organized around\\nsmart contracts running on ethereum  participants willing to support the\\n\\ndevelopment of the monetha project can do so by sending ether currency to the\\ndesignated address  by

platform  by shifting   of monetha s\\nrevenue in the  voucher smart contract  with an ability to claim for a voucher\\nproportionately to the amount of mth tokens that they hold  token holders will\\nreceive a voucher in mth  monetha s currency  to use it as a discount when\\nshopping with monetha s merchants  this voucher would be proportional to the\\namount of the mth tokens held \\n\\nhere s how it works \\n\\n let s say we have 1000 investors as mth holders  holding 1 mth each  now  all\\ntoken holders equally hold 0 1  of the total token supply \\n\\n let s say monetha s merchants sold 100 000 eth worth of goods and services in\\none month and let s say that 1eth   1mth  because monetha takes 1 5 \\ntransaction fee from merchants  monetha will have 1500 eth of revenue collected \\n\\n for this scenario   4 of monetha s revenue means   of 1500 eth   500 eth \\ntherefore  we will put 500 mth in the  voucher smart contract  \\n\\nwe get 500 mth voucher that is available to use for mth holders in monetha s\\necosystem  all 1000 mth holders will equally have the ability to use 500 mth\\n\\nm\\n\\n37\\n\\x0cvoucher when shopping with monetha s merchants  in this case  one token holder\\nwill be able to spend up to 0 1  of 500 mth   0 5 mth each  \\n\\nthis voucher will be redeemable if you transfer your mth tokens to the smart\\ncontract address on the 1st day of every month  then  within the 24 hour window \\nyour mth tokens will be returned to your wallet  you will be able to accumulate your\\nvoucher each month and spend the amount you collected over the 6 month period in\\nthe monetha s ecosystem  each month s collected mth voucher will be viable to\\nspend for the upcoming 6 months  unclaimed unused revenue from vouchers will be\\nput in a pool for the next month \\n\\nthe mth voucher is not compare to the mth token  the voucher is not transferable \\ncannot be sold and can only be used for purchasing discounted goods on the\\nmonetha platform \\n\\nthe duration of this incentive program will stay at full discretion of monetha  but will\\nat least last for the first 24 months starting from the first purchasing activity on

2020  e commerce share of retail sales is expected nto increase from 7 4  in 2015 to 14 6  in 2020  furthermore  according to statista  nthe number of people buying goods or services online will increase from 1 46 billion nin 2015 to above 2 billion in 2020  n ndespite the explosive growth  three major problems still exist  n n1  trust and reputation  building trust is difficult  and it is centrally governed by nbig marketplaces  there is an inability to transfer trust from one centralized nservice to another  and thus a need to establish relationship with each nmerchant separately  moreover  a merchant  s history is not recorded  so there nis no ability to punish fraudulent buyers or merchants  huge efforts and nadvertising budgets are needed to create trust if a merchant is not a part of a ncentralized marketplace  n n2  expensive and long payment process  there are 16    different steps to nsettle the transaction and up to 15    different fees to pay for payment ngateways  transaction fees range from 2    0 1 to 6    0 7  chargeback nfees of usd 15  moreover  existing payment gateways rarely offer a simple nsolution for a merchant to accept mobile payments on their website or point of nsale terminals  n n3  an inability to reach the growing ethereum economy  today  merchants ncannot accept payments in ether  which has reached a market cap of usd n36bn as of june 14th  moreover  a totally new digital asset class is being ncreated  tokens of products that are built on the ethereum platform  the rise nof a new kind of digital assets enables the creation of a token based digital nasset economy  it is expected that 10  of global gdp will be generated on nblockchains by 2025  merchants will definitely want to participate in the nblockchain created economy  n nmonetha is creating a universal decentralized trust and reputation solution nworking flawlessly together with mobile payments processing on the nethereum blockchain leveraging smart contract technology  n n1  universal transferable trust and reputation system  every time a n ntransaction is made the blockchain will record the time of the transaction  both nreceiving and sending wallet addresses  warranty conditions  delivery time  n nm n x0cand all other information that is typically needed to ensure trust  all the nsensitive information will be hashed and only available to authorized users in na beautifully designed user interface  based on that information  clients and nmerchants will be able to file solve a claim  rate each other  etc  every time a ntransaction is made  claim registered  solved or unsolved  according to nthe purchase details saved during the purchase   review written  etc   the nsmart contract will automatically change the trust level for each of the nparties involved  n n2  mobile payments solution  with the help of the ethereum blockchain  we nare able to make payments with only 1 step and 1 fee  which results in naccepting payments generally up to 5x cheaper and up to x10000 faster for nmerchants  after simple integration with monetha  merchants will be able to  nuse our decentralized trust and reputation system  accept ethereum based ntokens  accept mobile payments  and easily convert cryptocurrency to their nlocal fiat currency  n n3  enabling merchants to reach  10 trillion digital asset economy  by ndeveloping monetha  we will not only allow merchants to participate ina ntrustful decentralized economy  but also reach the growing digital asset neconomy through our payment solution  the world bank estimates that 10  nof global gdp will be generated on blockchains by 2025  the gdp estimated nfor 2025 is  100t  thus the value generated through blockchain is expected to nbe  10t  10    n nmobile payments  according to boston consulting group  the payment industry is nabout to experience a huge shift towards mobile payments  1  in 2015 mobile npayment volume was usd 8 6 billion in the us  it is expected to increase almost 32x nby 2021 to reach  274bn in the us alone  2  mobile share of total ecommerce is nexpected to increase to 48 5  of total e commerce by 2020  it was 23 6  in 2015  n nbusiness model  monetha will only have one fee  xe2 x80 x94 a 1 5  transaction fee for nmerchants  n ntoken and token ecosystem  a   of monetha xe2 x80 x99s revenue will be put in the  xe2 x80 x9cvoucher nsmart contract xe2 x80 x99 in a form of mth tokens to our token holders with an ability to claim for a nvoucher proportionately to the amount of mth tokens they hold  token holders will receive a nvoucher in mth  monetha xe2 x80 x99s currency  to use it as a discount when buying from monetha xe2 x80 x99s nmerchants  this voucher would be proportional to the amount of the mth tokens held  n nloyalty program  in order to encourage a network effect and create an ecosystem nfor the monetha token  we are going to introduce a loyalty program for merchants  n nm n x0cevery purchase made via the monetha payment system will reward the client of the nmerchant with 0 2   the exact percentage might change over time  of the value of nthe transaction in monetha tokens from the monetha loyalty pool  n n1  three significant problems that merchants nface  trust and reputation  payments  and an ninability to reach the growing ethereum neconomy n ne commerce has grown at an unprecedented rate and is projected to grow at an neven higher rate over the coming years  according to  xe2 x80 x9cstatista xe2 x80 x9d  retail e commerce n nsales worldwide in 2014 were usd 1 33 trillion and are projected to increase to usd n4 058 trillion by 2020  n n5 000 n n4 058 n nq 4 000 ng 3 418 n3 3 000 2 860 ns n8 2 352 n3 2 000 1915 n  1 336 1 548 n5 na a n n  2014 2015 2016 2017  2018  2019  2020  n nthe growth is perfectly illustrated by the number of shops created on the shopify nplatform  they had 84 000 shops in 2013  144 000 in 2014  243 000 in 2015 and nended 2016 with almost 378 000 merchants on the platform   a growth of 450  over n3 years  n nm n x0ce commerce is also gaining greater weight in total retail sales globally  it is expected nto increase from 7 4  in 2015 to 14 6  in 2020  furthermore  according to statista  nthe number of people buying goods or services online will increase from 1 46 billion n nin 2015 to above 2 billion in 2020  n ndespite the super high growth of e commerce  merchants face three major n nproblems  1  trust and reputation  2  expensive and long payment process  and n3  an inability to reach the growing ethereum ecosystem  with a market cap of n 36 billion and its corresponding ethereum token economy  n n1 1 trust and reputation problem in global e commerce n nbuilding trust is difficult  it takes time and costs a lot of money  it xe2 x80 x99s even more difficult nfor new or small merchants  n ntrust and reputation are extremely important for participants of today  s global ncommerce  people are more likely to buy from trusted merchants  therefore  nmerchants are striving to maximise their trust rating reputation and build a loyal ncustomer base  n naccording to econsultancy  61  of customers read online reviews before making a npurchase decision  moreover  according to reevo stats  63  of customers are more nlikely to make a purchase from a site which has user reviews and a proven trust nrating  n nconsumer reviews are significantly more trusted  nearly 12 times more  than ndescriptions that come from manufacturers  according to a survey of us internet nusers by the online video review site expo  furthermore  shopify  in one of their nmerchant blogs  emphasized that  xe2 x80 x9cshowing that others trust you xe2 x80 x9d is vital toa nmerchant  s success  n nthere are  however  a few major problems regarding trust that merchants face in ntoday  s global e commerce  n n1  the trust and reputation system to facilitate commerce is only possible in closed nmarketplaces  which are controlled by a central authority  in order to build trust  you nhave to join one or a few of the closed marketplaces  such as  amazon  ebay  nalibaba  etc  by joining them  merchant must accept all their rules  for example  20  ncommission from sales  n nm n x0c2  merchants have no ability to transfer their trust rate from one centralized nservice to another  for example  once you become trusted on amazon  you still must nbuild your trust on ebay or another marketplace  n n3  merchants have to invest considerable effort and finance into their brand and nadvertising if they do not want to join the centralized marketplace that facilitates ntrust and reputation  n n4  buyers need to establish a relationship with each merchant separately  nmoreover  a buyer xe2 x80 x99s history is not available for merchants to make decisions  being ntrusted with one merchant doesn  t mean you are trusted with another  n n5  there is no ability to punish fraudulent buyers or merchants and reflect that in their nhistory  most fraud happens due to stolen cards or stolen credit card information  in n2015  card fraud reached  21 84 billion  xe2 x80 x94 a figure that is expected to rise to  31 67 nbillion by 2020  according to advanced payment report 2016 conducted with the nhelp of wirecard de  92  of merchants say fraud will remain a prime concern for nonline payments  large e commerce and m commerce merchants lose 1 4  and n1 7  of revenues respectively to fraud according to the 2015 true cost of fraud nstudy  n nthere are millions of e commerce merchants outside closed marketplaces that need na universal trust and reputation system in order to be trusted by their clients  n nin order to build global trust in e commerce  we need a universal trust and nreputation system  payments and commerce using monetha will be done directly nbetween two unknown parties using a much needed decentralized  smart contract nbased  trust and reputation system  n n1 2 expensive and long payment process n ndespite having a wide variety of different payment gateways and processing ncompanies  the following major problems still exist for merchants  n ne costly and complex transaction settlements with up to 16    steps to accept nand settle transactions  n ne up to 15    different type of fees including a transaction fee of between 2  nto 6   and a chargeback fee of usd 20  n ne extremely high cross border transaction fees  n ne long transaction times ranging from 2 days to several weeks to receive their nmoney  e commerce payment processors often hold merchants xe2 x80 x99 money for a nweek due to higher probability of chargebacks during first week after n nm n x0c1 2 1 n npurchase  n nmobile payments  mobile payment solutions are fragmented and not available nuniversally or simply not easy to use despite a strong consumer appetite to nleverage them  payment processors rarely offer a simple solution for a nmerchant to accept mobile payments  n ncurrent payment process n nthe picture below describes the payment confirmation or rejection in 8 steps at the ntime of payment regardless of it being in a physical store  e commerce or nm commerce  the process is complex and includes 8

ntransactional fees stand somewhere between 2  and 6  per transaction nplus a fixed fee which is between usd 0 1 and usd 0 7  for example  every ntime someone makes a transaction for usd 10  the

by the retailer to prove the n nm n x0ctransaction was done respecting the rules  this costs time and money  when nthe info is missing  the charge is reversed even if it was legit  n ne flat fees

3 days to nsettle the transaction  for international payments  it can take up to a week or neven more  moreover  payment gateways more often than not hold your money for a nweek  n nthat often causes cash flow problems for small merchants  n n1 2 4 mobile payments n naccording to statcounter  october 2016 was the first ever month in the history when nmore users around the world accessed the internet from mobile devices than from ndesktop computers  of all users  51 3  used mobile devices while 48 7  used ncomputers  moreover  according to statista  approximately 80  of internet usage nwill be mobile by 2018  at the same time  mobile payments are projected to nincrease from usd 8 6bn in 2015 to usd 274bn in 2021  n nthe problem is that most e commerce and retail payment gateways and or terminals n nwere developed to accept and process payments using physical credit cards  and at ntheir core  cards are not mobile friendly  payment gateways rarely offer a simple n nm n x0csolution for a merchant to accept mobile payments in their website or point of sale nterminals  n n1 3 an inability to participate in token enabled digital asset neconomy potentially worth  10t in 2025  n nthe market cap of all the ethereum tokens is growing extraordinarily fast  ether nreached a market cap of usd 36bn as of june 14th  but most importantly  a totally nnew market of digital assets is being created  tokens of projects that are built on nethereum platform  the rise of new kind of digital assets enables the creation of a ntoken based digital asset economy  n na correspondent of bloomberg talks about it here  starting from 2 00  n nthe world bank estimates that 10  of global gdp will be generated on blockchains nby 2025  the gdp estimated for 2025 is  100t

participate in the token economy within the next few years  n n2  monetha xe2 x80 x99s solution  a decentralized trust and nreputation system working flawlessly together nthrough a blockchain based payment gateway n nwe are creating a decentralized payment and trust solution on the ethereum nblockchain leveraging smart contract technology  the payment solution works nflawlessly together with our decentralized trust and reputation system  merchants will nbe able to accept ethereum based cryptocurrencies and exchange them with ntraditional  fiat  currencies  merchants and customers will participate in global ndecentralized commerce with total trust  n nmonetha is on a mission to  n ne develop a global decentralized trust and reputation system for tomorrow  s nglobal e commerce  n nm n x0ce make the payment process simple and efficient  only one step  n ne make accepting payments for merchants generally up to 5x cheaper and up nto 10 000 times faster  n ne provide an opportunity for merchants to accept mobile payments  n ne bring the ethereum based token economy to the mainstream  n ne expand ethereum real world application infrastructure  n nin simple words  our mission is to develop and deploy the best transaction system that nwould be based on enforceable contracts without third party between consumer and nmerchants and a strong decentralised reputation management system  transaction nand fund transfer will be done in one step together with the enforceable sale ncontract  transaction fees would be simplified from many to a simple transaction fee nwherever the consumer and merchants are located on the planet  n n2 1 a universal decentralized trust and reputation system on nthe ethereum blockchain  ensuring trust in global commerce  n nbuilding trust is difficult because  n ne merchants need to become part of a centrally governed marketplace  like namazon  ebay  alibaba  etsy  etc  where they must pay a sales commission  n ne merchants cannot transfer their trust from one centralized service to another  n ne merchants need to invest huge efforts and budgets into brand and advertising nif not being part of centralized marketplace  n ne complicated conflict management using existing system  n ne buyers need to establish a relationship with each merchant separately and ntheir history is not transparent  n ne there is no ability to punish fraudulent buyers or merchants and reflect that in ntheir history  n nmonetha xe2 x80 x99s trust and reputation system will be universal  transparent  ntransferable  self executing  not controlled by a central authority  and working nflawlessly together with a payment solution  n n2 1 1 how it works n nevery time a transaction is made  no matter if it xe2 x80 x99s retail or e commerce  the nblockchain will save the time of the transaction  both the receiving and sending naddresses  warranty conditions  delivery time  and all other information that is ntypically needed to ensure the trust  all the sensitive information will be hashed and nonly available to authorized users in a beautifully designed user interface  based on n nm n n10 n x0cthat information  clients and merchants will be able to file solve a claim  rate each nother  etc  n ndefault trust rates will be created for both merchant and client using the monetha necosystem for the first time  a trust rating will be assigned to a specific wallet naddress  every time a transaction is made  claim registered  solved or unsolved n according to the purchase details saved during the purchase   review written  netc   the smart contract will automatically change the trust level for each of the nparties involved  n nthe merchant trust rating n nonce the merchant starts accepting mobile ethereum based currency payments nusing monetha  a default trust rating will be created  smart contract will automatically nchange the trust rating according to the behavior of the merchant  for example  n ne does the merchant react to claims from clients  n ne does the merchant react quickly to claims from clients  n ne doclients rate the merchant for delivering products as promised  on time  as nadvertised and in good quality  n ne does the merchant have good reviews from clients  n ndifferent weights will be assigned to different actions  n nthe trust rating will be visible to everyone in the most common and typical places  nsuch as the footer of the merchant  s website or mobile app  the only way the nmerchant can increase the trust rating is by providing products or services as nadvertised and in good condition  n ntrust client xe2 x80 x99s trust rating n nthe main reason to create a trust rating for the client is to decrease the likelihood of nfraudulent buyers and offer loyalty features for trustful buyers  n nonce a client buys something from a merchant using monetha for the first time  the ndefault trust rating for that client will be automatically created and linked to the wallet naddress of that client  n nthe client trust rating will be updated automatically by the smart contract based on nhis or her behavior  different weights will be assigned to different actions  for nexample  n nm n n11 n x0cwhat is the client xe2 x80 x99s claim history  n nhow many claims has the user made  are those claims being resolved  nhave all the previous claims been solved with merchants  n npurchase history  behavior  frequency  etc  n nthe trust rate of the client will be available to see on the blockchain and visible in a nuser friendly interface to merchants once the purchase is made  n nthe client xe2 x80 x99s trust rating will be visible on the blockchain or in monetha xe2 x80 x99s mobile app  n nin totally decentralized e commerce  it is important that merchants have information nabout the client  the most important thing for a merchant is to avoid someone who ndoes hazardous things on purpose  if that happens  the merchant will be able to ndecrease the client  s trust rating significantly  based on that information  other nmerchants will be able to decide whether they want to sell products to a client with a nlow trust rating  n nclaims  reviews and conflict management  n nevery purchase will be saved on the blockchain together with the time of the ntransaction  both receiving and sending addresses  warranty conditions  estimated ndelivery date  the product that was bought and all other information that is typically nneeded to ensure trust  n nthe following information will be available to both parties  n ne the merchant will have all the information about every transaction with the nabove mentioned details in his profile in the monetha system  n ne the client will be able to see all his purchases together with the nabove mentioned details only in his profile within the monetha mobile app  n nbased on that information  parties will have an opportunity to file resolve claims  nreview  and rate each other in a transparent way  smart contract will automatically ndecrease or increase the trust rating  that kind of management of conflict resolution nthrough smart contracts will help each party to deal with the situation faster  easier nand cheaper  no chargeback fees for the merchant   n nexamples  n1  claim  once the client makes a purchase  all the needed information is saved n nto the blockchain  in order to see that information  the client must download nthe monetha app  once he logs in  he sees all the purchases he made with a n nm n n12 n x0cparticular wallet address anywhere using monetha as a payment gateway  nthe client selects the particular purchase he is not happy about  and initiates na claim by providing the details of the claim  e g   the product is broken  the nmerchant  s trust rating is immediately decreased  so the merchant is nincentivized to solve the problem as quickly as possible  the merchant nreceives the notification about the claim  looks at the details and contacts the nclient off chain  client and merchant agree on the solution and one of the nparties initiates a resolution by pressing the  claim resolved  button in the nmobile app or the merchant system  details of how the situation was resolved n product changed  money returned  etc   must be provided as well  the details nare saved to the blockchain  the other party gets the notification  reads the ndetails and agrees by pressing  xe2 x80 x9cclaim resolved xe2 x80 x9d  once the claim is resolved  ntrust rating is increased for both parties instantly  n n  reviews  clients and merchants will be able to write reviews about each nother  written reviews will have more weight on each other  s trust rating than njust  xe2 x80 x9csilent xe2 x80 x9d transactions without a review  for example  a client  s review about na good product and customer service will increase the merchant  s trust rating nmore than just a simple  xe2 x80 x9csilent xe2 x80 x9d transaction without writing a review  reviews nabout the merchant will be visible in the mobile app for a client  merchants will nsee the reviews clients have written about them in their system  all reviews  ngood and bad  will be automatically reflected in the trust rating of the nclient and the merchant  n n  sales contracts  a merchant can propose a 15 day return policy   no nquestions asked  this merchant will be in a better position to sell than the one nwho does not offer a return policy  these rules will be published by the nmerchant  smart contract will ensure merchants and consumers are nrespecting their commitments to each other and the rating system will reflect nthat  n n2 1 2 how the likelihood of fraud is reduced with a global decentralized nreputation and trust system n nthe trust rate will be available and visible to everyone in the ecosystem so that nparties are incentivized to increase their trust rating  which will enable better ndecision making and a safer e commerce environment  moreover  we will offer nincentives such as a reduced transaction fee  faster transaction times  etc   for those nwho hold higher ratings and proven history  this level of transparency could ndecrease fraud significantly or at least make it more difficult  n nm n n13 n x0cto illustrate this point  kevin kelly  the author of a book titled  xe2 x80 x9cout of control xe2 x80 x99  wrote  n na pretty good society needs more than just anonymity  an online ncivilization requires online anonymity  online identification  online nauthentication  online reputations  online trust holders  online nsignatures  online privacy  and online access  all are essential ningredients of any open society  n nwe bring this to the next level  we want to create a transferable trust system so that nevery merchant  big and small  retail or e commerce  will be able to join a nglobal decentralized trust rating system by accepting mobile payments with nmonetha  n n2 2 a mobile payments solution to accept mobile ethereum nbased cryptocurrency payments generally up to 5x cheaper nand up to x10000 faster  n nafter simple integration with monetha  merchants will be able to  n ne use our decentralized trust and reputation system  ne accept ethereum based tokens  ne easily convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency  n n2 2 1 how it works  e commerce example n nclients will pick their items  add them to the cart and select that they will pay through nthe monetha gateway instead of other available options such as credit card or npaypal  n nthe amount needed to pay is converted to the selected ethereum based currency n token  from traditional currency in real time  a qr code is generated which the nclient scans with any crypto wallet on his mobile app and presses  xe2 x80 x9csend xe2 x80 x9d  money narrives in merchant  s smart contract wallet in approximately 2 minutes  the amount nof ethereum based currency received is exchanged to a merchant xe2 x80 x99s preferred fiat ncurrency according to the merchant  s preference via kraken or another crypto nexchange api  merchants will be able to choose the frequency at which crypto ntokens are converted to fiat  the local currency to exchange to  time of sending nmoney to their bank account  and many other options  n nm n n14 n x0cmonetha is easy  fast  cheap  and guaranteed by smart contracts  nhow merchant payment fees and transaction time are resolved n nthe picture below shows how blockchain changes the method of payment  the ntransaction goes from customer to merchant directly  ditching all the intermediaries in nthe process and saving merchants a huge amount of time and money  there is no nneed to close or settle anything for merchant anymore  the settlement and closing nhappens at the same time as the transaction  there is only 1 step instead of 16  n nas the payment now goes directly from the client to merchant  instead of waiting for nup to 2 weeks to see the funds  it arrives approximately 2 minutes after the npurchase no matter where in the world the purchase was made  n nas far as payment fees are concerned  instead of 15 types of fees merchants may npay using a standard payment gateway  with monetha  they will have only 1 fee  a ntransaction fee of 1 5   n nthe chargeback fee goes away as well  once the merchant agrees to send the nmoney back  they just send the money back and pay the transaction fee  no nridiculously high chargeback fees anymore  in addition  the pain  time and money to nprove the transaction is legit  is gone  moreover  the decentralized trust and nreputation system helps to decrease the rate of fraudulent payments as well  n nultimately  it xe2 x80 x99s up to x5 cheaper and up to x10000 faster for merchants to accept npayments with monetha  with a transparent fee structure with no chargeback or nhidden fees  and a beautiful user interface with smart contract enabled wallet nsecurity  n n15 n x0c   n    n ne  clients bank n nmerchants bank n  x  ncredit card network ni  n n xe2 x80 x9c ncredit card network nv n n      n      n nv nen nee n nnonead of settlement and closing of account n nsmart contract based wallet for merchants n nthe merchant  s account acts as the equivalent of a bank account that stores funds nand enforces security  the crucial fact here is that it  s only controlled by the user  the nmerchant  today  banks hold higher authority because they run the database that npoints at the database entry which says you have that money and you have to trust nthat your money is safe  banks own the control of that database and authority to ngrant or deny the access to the money they hold  not anymore  n nmonetha will not be able to suspend  hold or prevent any transaction  instead  npermissionless transactions will be guaranteed by the smart contract  instantly  and nas promised  no more headache of not knowing where the merchant xe2 x80 x99s money is and nwhy it xe2 x80 x99s being withheld  n nmerchants can customize their settings to fit their preferences  such as  n ne how much funds to exchange with the local currency  ne how often to exchange  ne others  n nwith monetha  we are giving control of merchant funds back into their own hands nand giving them easy to manage control of their funds received from selling goods or nservices which is safeguarded by the security of smart contracts  now  merchants n nm n n16 n x0ccan have better security and substantially improved usability  nit is literally a merchant becoming his own bank  n n2 2 2 case studies  merchant fees and transaction time nmerchant fees n njohn is the owner of a small e commerce store selling t shirts for usd 10  he was nalways frustrated by the transactions fees he paid to the banks and other nintermediaries  n none day  he found out about monetha through a financial news article and decided nto try it out  it took him only a few minutes to get started  now the transaction money ngoes directly from the client to his account  that means that from now on  john will nnot only be able to accept mobile payments  but also  more importantly  instead of npaying every intermediary in the payment process from 2  0 1 up to 6  0 7 per ntransaction  john now pays only 1 5  per transaction  so instead of paying eur 0 8 non average every time someone buys a t shirt  john will now only pay eur 0 15 nper transaction using monetha as his mobile payments processor  that xe2 x80 x99s 5x times ncheaper on average  n nmoreover  monetha exchanges ethereum based currencies with his local currency nand sends the money to his bank according to predefined settings  upon his request nor automatically  n ntransaction time and cash flow problems  e commerce merchant  n npeter has a website where he sells various home appliances to customers all around nthe globe for almost 12 years now  he knows money is just a digit that must be nexchanged once the transaction is made  that xe2 x80 x99s why he cannot believe how long it ntakes for him to receive the funds after a client places an order  n nif the client is local  the funds show up in his bank account in up to 2 3 days  but if nthe client is from the other side of the world  it may take up to 2 weeks for funds to nshow up his bank account  he has to trust the client and the banks and ship the nproduct before he receives the funds  moreover  the payment gateway often holds nthe money for a week  because of the time it takes for him to receive the money  he noften experiences cash flow problems and  consequently  is not able to pay nhis suppliers  n none day  a friend of peter told him about monetha  the friend told him that it takes n nm n n17 n x0cup to 2 minutes to receive money with monetha after a purchase was made  with nmonetha  peter can accept mobile payments and receive funds instantly no nmatter where the client is after the purchase is made  he no longer has to trust nbanks  payment gateways or pdf files generated as a proof of payment that clients nsend him  furthermore  monetha solved his cash flow problems instantly  he nreceives funds  can ship products instantly and order more shoes without a fear of nnot being able to pay  n n2 3 enabling merchants to reach  10 trillion digital asset

holders for an ability nto use that in the monetha xe2 x80 x99s ecosystem and other 1  will go to the company as nrevenues  n nan interesting fact is that the average traditional payment gateways take napproximately only 0 25    0 1 from total fee as their revenue  this 0 25    0 1 is a nmark up fee to the interchange rates  n nfor example  if the total transaction fee that merchant is charged is 2 35     0 2  nthe 2 1    0 2 is the interchange part that banks  credit card associations and nothers are dividing and 0 25     0 1 is the markup part  which payment gateways ntake home as revenue  we not only decrease the transaction fee that merchant has nto pay  let alone the other fees that he will not have to worry about anymore  but we nare also left with approximately four times the rate to do business with  n nm n n31 n x0c5  marketing and strategy n5 1 network effect n nour strategy is focused on creating a network effect as our decentralized trust and nreputation system enables us to do that  moreover  we will use the well known nbowling pin strategy  start with a niche market  stage 2  existing crypto community   nand then move to other niches and broader markets  n nstage 1  in our case  we are focusing on the supply side first  being accepted in as nmany locations as fast as possible through partnerships that enables instant scale  nto achieve that  we will partner with payment providers that can give us instant nscale  we are already in positive talks with major players  revel systems and nshopify  being the biggest  as of the end of 2016  shopify had over 377k

 no nspending limit  n nstage 3  broader market adoption  n n1  once again  supply side first  monetha is accepted in even more nlocations globally  n n2  education of general public  supply increases exposure and people are nwilling to buy more from trusted merchants  only merchants accepting npayments through monetha will be guaranteed to be trustful by ndecentralized reputation and trust system  n n3  once there are more people willing to pay with their mobile phones at ntrusted merchants  more merchants will join the network  n nnetwork effect is very well illustrated by metcalfe xe2 x80

alue of a network   n n 1  2  where n is number of people using the network n nfocusing on the supply side first drives the demand which in turn drives the supply  nnetwork effect kicks in  the more users there are  the more valuable it is  this nrapid adoption is then self perpetuating as both sides value the access to a bigger nnetwork of users  read  xe2 x80 x98more choice xe2 x80 x99   xe2 x80 x98higher probability of finding a match xe2 x80 x99  coupled n nm n n32 n x0cwith the improved transaction experience  n nthe importance of network effect was very well described by the vice
